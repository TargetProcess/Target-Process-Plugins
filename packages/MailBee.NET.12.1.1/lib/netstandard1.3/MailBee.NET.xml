            <summary>
            Provides means for bulk verification of e-mail addresses.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>This class can validate single addresses and their lists (string array and <see cref="!:System.Data.DataTable"/> are accepted).
            If your data source is different, you can also create and populate <see cref="!:System.Data.DataTable"/> manually, using <see cref="!:ArrayToDataTable"/> method.</para>
            <para>There are several levels of verification: syntax check with a regular expression, DNS MX lookup of the domain part of the address,
            test connection to the SMTP MX server responsible for delivering e-mail to the given domain, and test send attempt (which means not only the connection is made but also
            the sender and the recipient are submitted to the server). Even in "send attempt" mode, the component does not actually send any e-mails, it
            stops at the point where the server accepted the given e-mail address as the valid recipient's address. How deep the verification will be is controlled with
            <see cref="P:MailBee.AddressCheck.EmailAddressValidator.ValidationLevel"/> property.</para>
            <para>You can implement black and white listing of any e-mail addresses or domains in your collection by subscribing to
            <see cref="!:Verifying"/> event. It lets you skip any e-mails from verification, based on your criteria.</para>
            <para>By default, the component works in single-thread mode. If you need to verify multiple addresses, you can greatly improve performance
            by setting <see cref="P:MailBee.AddressCheck.EmailAddressValidator.MaxThreadCount"/> property. Up to 60 threads are supported.</para>
            <note>Due to anti-spam filters on many servers, direct validation of e-mail addresses via making test connections and send attempts is not always 100% accurate
            (there can be both false positives and false negatives).
            See <see cref="T:MailBee.AddressCheck.AddressValidationLevel"/> topic for more details on how to deal with this.</note>
            <para>For more info and tutorials, refer to <a href="getting_started_with_address_validator.html">Getting started with Address Validator</a> guide.</para>
            <note>Database-related functionality is not available in .NET Core and UWP (only single e-mail addresses can be validated there).</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>This advanced sample reads and parses the list of e-mail addresses from C:\Temp\input.txt file (creating file it it's missing),
            performs blacklist check to remove all addresses ending with "@blacklisted.com", and verifies other addresses. Addresses with bad syntax
            are removed immediately, those which failed due to network errors are given second and third chance. Each run of the app performs a new
            check on the same list. In the end, no addresses will remain in the list as all the addresses there are fake (you can add real addresses
            so that the list wouldn't get empty).</para>
            <para>For simpler (but less accurate and flexible) examples, refer to <see cref="M:MailBee.AddressCheck.EmailAddressValidator.Verify(System.String)"/> or <see cref="!:Verified"/> topics.</para>
            <para>For clarity of its functioning, this sample does not use multi-threading (<see cref="P:MailBee.AddressCheck.EmailAddressValidator.MaxThreadCount"/> remains the default value, 1).
            In production, multi-threading is highly recommended for performance sake.</para>

            <remarks>
            <para>When MailBee encounters any error, it throws the <see cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeException"/>.
            However, in most cases MailBee itself traps this exception. For instance,
            if connecting to a certain SMTP server or making DNS MX lookup fails for a certain domain,
            <see cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeException"/> is thrown and then trapped by MailBee itself,
            but no exception will be thrown to the application code. Instead, MailBee understands that the given e-mail address is invalid,

            <para><see cref="E:MailBee.AddressCheck.EmailAddressValidator.ErrorOccurred"/> event allows the developer to track both warnings and critical

            exception and do not pass it to the application code.</para>
            <para>Note that not any occurrence of this event indicates that some e-mail address was considered invalid.
            For instance, if test SMTP connection to a primary SMTP MX server of some e-mail domain failed, this will raise
            <see cref="E:MailBee.AddressCheck.EmailAddressValidator.ErrorOccurred"/> event. But if this domain has secondary SMTP MX, MailBee will then try it too, and it
            the connection succeeds, the e-mail address will be considered OK.</para>

            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>If you're running the check from the machine which does not have a properly configured DNS PTR record (also known as rDNS),
            many servers will reject connections from you. Most computers sending spam do not have such DNS records and the lack of it makes other servers think you're a spammer.</description></item>
            <item><description>If the IP address of that machine is black-listed in some common RBL databases, you'll get the same results.</description></item>
            <item><description>Many servers may indicate some temporary problems even when you try to submit them a valid address. If you got an <see cref="F:MailBee.AddressCheck.AddressValidationLevel.SendAttempt"/> error
            for some e-mail address, try to repeat the check in a few hours and if it fails too, next day. Only 3-4 consequtive <see cref="F:MailBee.AddressCheck.AddressValidationLevel.SendAttempt"/> failures can prove that the e-mail address is really dead.
            This only applies to <see cref="F:MailBee.AddressCheck.AddressValidationLevel.SendAttempt"/> checks. For instance, if the e-mail address has invalid syntax, this is not gonna change if you try again later.</description></item>
            <item><description>Opposite scenario, when <see cref="F:MailBee.AddressCheck.AddressValidationLevel.SendAttempt"/> passes successfully, it still does not guarantee that the e-mail address is correct as some servers
            accept any name in their domain as valid address during SMTP session, but later send bounce to the sender. Unfortunately, there is no way to workaround this but to extend
            your system with some mailbox where bounces will arrive, you'll parse them, extract invalid addresses and remove them from your database.
            MailBee can provide some help with this, see <see cref="!:MailBee.BounceMail.DeliveryStatusParser"/> class for details.</description></item>

            Provides properties and methods for checking e-mails messages for spam
            probability and learning the filter from proven spam and non-spam messages.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>The filter uses the existing database of spam and non-spam messages to score
            new messages in the range of 0-100%. 0% corresponds to absolutely non-spam message,
            100% corresponds to absolutely spam message.</para>
            <para>The key point is learning the filter: telling the filter which messages
            are spam or non-spam. This is called training the filter.</para>
            <para>Initially, while the database is empty, the filter has no existing
            messages which to compare with the message in question.</para>
            <para>Thus, the first task is to train the filter with several hundreds of typical spam and
            non-spam messages you usually get. This will increase the filter efficiency from zero
            to the suitable value. The training should, however, continue in the future to further
            improve the quality of spam recognition. The larger database is, the better spam/non-spam
            recognition is.</para>
            <para>The filter will operate correctly ONLY if it was trained with a good number of spam
            AND non-spam messages.</para>
            <para>You can train the filter using <see cref="M:MailBee.AntiSpam.BayesFilter.TrainFilter(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,System.Boolean)"/> method.</para>
            <para>To score a message (determine if it's spam or not), use <see cref="M:MailBee.AntiSpam.BayesFilter.ScoreMessage(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage)"/> method.</para>
            <note>MailBee also supports other technologies which can be used as a sort of antispam check. They include DNS RBL filter (<see cref="T:MailBee.AntiSpam.RblFilter"/> class),
            full support of <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys"/> (signing and verification of e-mails using DomainKeys
            signatures) and DNX MX/Reverse DNS checks (see <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.GetMXHosts(System.String)"/> and
            <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.GetPtrData(System.String)"/> methods).</note>

            <summary>
            Provides methods to filter spam by checking e-mails and IP addresses against DNS RBL databases.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>The methods of this class make DNS queries to RBL servers to check if a particular address is in blacklists. Multiple RBLs can be checked simultaneously, greatly improving performance.</para>
            <para>If you don't know the IP address but have a mail message you want to check, you can also pass a <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> and MailBee will extract the originating IP address from
            Received headers.</para>
            <para>Unlike <see cref="T:MailBee.AntiSpam.BayesFilter"/> class, this class doesn't require you to train the filter first, it's always ready for immediate use.</para>
            <para>Popular RBLs you can use (although you're free to change or extend this list in any way):
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>zen.spamhaus.org</description></item>
            <item><description>bl.spamcop.net</description></item>
            <item><description>cbl.abuseat.org</description></item>
            </list>
            </para>
            <note>RBLs are third-party resources, they can block DNS requests from your machine for any reason (for instance, if you make too many queries daily or hourly).
            Moreover, some RBLs like Barracuda won't let you use them until you create an account in their system. It's recommended to keep volume of DNS queries as low as possible. For instance,
            you should disable DNS TCP and leave only DNS UDP. Also, MailBee by default caches earlier received results of checking IP addresses in <see cref="T:MailBee.DnsMX.DnsCache"/> so it won't make
            another request if the given IP address has already been checked during the current session of your program.</note>
            <note>When passing DNS RBL host name, be sure to make no typos. The nature of DNS is that if you make a typo in RBL name, it will have an effect like there is no IP address in the given RBL
            but no error may occur. This is because there is no actual connection with any server occurs, RBL is purely DNS thing. Errors usually occur only if for some queries your DNS server time out
            for some reason.</note>
            <para>You can combine using RBLs with Bayesian filter (<see cref="T:MailBee.AntiSpam.BayesFilter"/> class) or DKIM checks (e.g. <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.DomainKeysVerify"/>).
            It's also possible to check reverse DNS (PTR), MX records, SPF. Check "Filter spam with DNS queries (MX, SPF, DKIM, reverse DNS)" tutorial in Developer's Guide for more.</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>This sample checks an e-mail against popular RBLs (the e-mail is loaded from a file but could also be received from a mail server, the only requirement is that the message must have Received header
            from which MailBee will determine the IP address the message originated from).</para>
            <para>The sample also fine-tunes DNS checking routine for better performance (at cost of lower accuracy). You can remove "For performance sake" section to return to default DNS settings.</para>

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>When MailBee encounters any error, it throws the <see cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeException"/>.
            However, in most cases MailBee itself traps this exception. For instance,
            if connecting to a certain SMTP server or making DNS MX lookup fails for a certain domain,
            <see cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeException"/> is thrown and then trapped by MailBee itself,
            but no exception will be thrown to the application code. Instead, MailBee understands that the given e-mail address is invalid,
            and continues. Such errors are called <i>warnings</i>.</para>
            <para><see cref="E:MailBee.AntiSpam.RblFilter.ErrorOccurred"/> event allows the developer to track both warnings and critical
            errors because it's raised for a particular exception even if MailBee will trap this
            exception and do not pass it to the application code.</para>
            <para>Note that not any occurrence of this event indicates that some e-mail address was considered invalid.
            For instance, if test SMTP connection to a primary SMTP MX server of some e-mail domain failed, this will raise
            <see cref="E:MailBee.AntiSpam.RblFilter.ErrorOccurred"/> event. But if this domain has secondary SMTP MX, MailBee will then try it too, and it
            the connection succeeds, the e-mail address will be considered OK.</para>
            <para>Thus, <see cref="E:MailBee.AntiSpam.RblFilter.ErrorOccurred"/> event is mainly intended for informational and debugging purposes.</para>

            <para>These flags affect how MailBee selects authentication methods for login process.</para>
            <para>By default, MailBee takes the list of the desired authentication methods (specified by
            <i>authMethods</i> parameter of <see cref="M:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.Login(System.String,System.String,System.String,System.String,MailBee.AuthenticationMethods,MailBee.AuthenticationOptions,MailBee.SaslMethod)">Pop3.Login</see> method for <b>Pop3</b>,
            <i>authMethods</i> parameter of <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Login(System.String,System.String,System.String,System.String,MailBee.AuthenticationMethods,MailBee.AuthenticationOptions,MailBee.SaslMethod)">Imap.Login</see> method for <b>Imap</b>,
            or by <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.AuthMethods">SmtpServer.AuthMethods</see> property for <b>Smtp</b>),
            filters out the methods not advertized by the server in its capabilities, and then
            tries the remained methods until compatible method is found. If such method was found, it's
            used for the authentication process. If not, an exception is thrown if exceptions are enabled.</para>
            <para>The flags in this enumeration allow the developer to change the default behavior of MailBee.
            </para>
            <para>The above means that the authentication process is actually two-step. First, the appropriate method is selected,
            then, it's tried. Most flags affect how the appropriate method is selected (i.e. the first step). <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.DisableSimpleMethodAfterSecure"/> flag,
            however, affects what happens after the second step (what to do if the authentication fails).</para>

            Force MailBee not to switch to other authentication methods if the best (most secure) of the desired methods
            is not supported by the server. Usually makes sense only if <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.TryUnsupportedMethods"/> flag is set too because otherwise
            the possibly unsupported methods won't even be tried at all.

        <member name="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.PreferSimpleMethods">
            <summary>
            Force MailBee to try simple (i.e. non-secure) authentication methods before secure ones.
            In other words, MailBee will iterate through the list of desired methods in reverse order.
            This option is useful for communicating with mail servers which have errors
            in their secure authentication implementations.
            This flag is also set by default if <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.SafeMode"/> was <b>true</b>. However, if you would better
            prefer to use secure methods if possible, consider using <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.DisableSimpleMethodAfterSecure"/> flag.

        <member name="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.DisableSimpleMethodAfterSecure">
            <summary>
            If this flag is set, MailBee won't retry the login attempt with a simple method if the currently tried secure method failed
            the authentication. Set this flag if you require the client to always use secure authentication. Do not set this flag
            if the server has problems with its implementation of security algorithms (many servers advertize secure authentication capability
            but in fact do not implement it correctly). The flag has no effect if non-secure methods are not available (e.g. when IMAP server advertizes LOGINDISABLED
            or SMTP server advertizes nothing but NTLM), or if <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.PreferSimpleMethods"/> flag is set (because the simple method would have already been tried to the moment),
            or if <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.UseSingleMethodOnly"/> flag is set (because it assumes the highest level of security).

        <member name="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.PreferSspiOverNegotiateStream">
            <summary>
            If this flag is set, MailBee will use SSPI implementation of NTLM and GSSAPI methods. This implementation
            requires <b>UnmanagedCode</b> permission due to the need to access Windows API. If this flag is not set,
            MailBee will use <b>NegotiateStream</b> managed implementation and thus not require <b>UnmanagedCode</b> permission.
            Setting this flag sometimes helps with MS Exchange connectivity. Also, this flag has no effect for UWP and .NET Core apps as they either can't work with <b>NegotiateStream</b>
            (and SSPI implementation is used even if this flag is not set) or can't work via SSPI and <b>NegotiateStream</b> is always used. .NET Standard 2.0 edition of MailBee.NET.dll always uses
            <b>NegotiateStream</b> approach.

            If this flag is set and no domain is specified (neither in account name nor in separate domain parameter),
            MailBee will use the local domain name for that. If not set, MailBee will use empty domain name in this case.
            This flag is only used with NTLM and GSSAPI authentication methods.

            This class provides methods for OAuth 2.0 authentication process.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>OAuth enables websites or applications to access users' mailboxes and profile data without requiring users
            to disclose their credentials to these web sites or applications.
            It means that a 3d party application doesn't need to get the username and the password to access data via API
            from the restricted application.</para>
            <para>For instance, your application can ask the user to authorize its attempt to access data in their Gmail or Outlook.com mailbox.
            MailBee provides your application with the URL on Google or Microsoft web site which should be opened in the browser. The page asks the user if they confirm that
            your application is trusted to access their mailbox. If the user confirms that, Google or Microsoft returns the authorization key.
            The application then use this key to get an access token from Google or Microsoft server, and then you can then use it with OAuth 2.0 method when logging in Gmail or Microsoft account
            of the user. The same will work for any OAuth 2.0 capable provider which supports XOAUTH2 extension in their IMAP or SMTP service.</para>
            <para>The methods of this class help you complete OAuth 2.0 authorization process and get OAuth keys which can be used
            for authentication on IMAP/SMTP servers that support XOAUTH2 extension. You can also use this class to get OAuth 2.0 keys for
            other purposes with any software capable of OAuth 2.0 authentication because the produced keys are not specific to MailBee.</para>
            <note>You can refer to <a href="OAuth2.html">OAuth 2.0 in Windows and ASP.NET MVC apps</a> topic for detailed
            tutorials on using OAuth 2.0 with Outlook.com, Live.com, Hotmail.com, Gmail (including Google Apps specific case, Service Accounts).
            The tutorials cover many related aspects such as refresh tokens, passing OAuth authorization code from OAuth providers' web sites to the application,
            IIS configuration, etc.</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>This sample authenticates client in Gmail IMAP via OAuth 2.0 using DotNetOpenAuth library (.NET 3.5+).
            User should get registered their application as described here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/guide/aaa_oauth" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/guide/aaa_oauth</a>
            and specify the keys received from Google in the application code (<c>clientID</c> and <c>clientSecret</c> variables) along with their e-mail address.

            The second sample connects to a regular Google account. In its IMAP part, it's similar to the sample in <see cref="T:MailBee.OAuth2"/> topic but uses
            Google API Auth Client library instead of DotNetOpenAuth.dll. The key advantage is that no user input is required (copy-paste from the browser to the console).
            Also, it shows OAuth2 usage with SMTP, not just IMAP.

            <summary>
            This class provides methods for OpenID authentication process. It can be used with
            <see cref="T:MailBee.OAuth"/> class for hybrid OpenID + OAuth authentication.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>OpenID + OAuth hybrid method makes it possible to access certain data (like e-mails) in the user account
            without requiring the user to enter their e-mail address and password, provided that the user is already
            logged into their account by other means.</para>
            <para>For instance, if the user is logged in their Gmail account on that computer and the user accesses
            your web application, it can get access to the e-mails in that account if the user permits this. The user
            just needs to click a button (confirmation from Google to grant access to the user's data to your web application), 
            it's not required to enter the login or password. Also, your application does not get access to your account's password,
            only to your account's data.</para>
            <para>To make requests for approval, your application must be registered on the web site of a service provider.
            E.g. if you want to let users grant you with the access to their Gmail mailboxes, you'll need to register your
            application with Google, or with Yahoo in order to access Yahoo Mail accounts. In return, the service provider
            assigns you a <b>consumer key</b> and <b>consumer secret</b> you'll need to pass to the service each time you make a request for a user's data.</para>
            <para>See "Federated Login for Google Account Users" on Google web site for additional information on how to
            register your site in Google.</para>
            <note>This class provides helper classes which support OpenID + OAuth implementations of Google and Yahoo.
            You can, however, add any other implementation which sets OpenID/OAuth parameters as required by your service
            provider. For that, create and populate <i>parameters</i> object in the samples below not using <see cref="M:MailBee.OpenID.GetParamsForGoogleOpenIdWithOAuth"/>
            or <see cref="M:MailBee.OpenID.GetParamsForYahooOpenIdWithOAuth"/> methods. Or, you can use these methods and then adjust
            the resulting object in case if the implementation you're working with is very close to Google or Yahoo
            (for instance, simply requires adding an extra parameter).</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>This topic contains samples for both Google (Gmail) and Yahoo below.</para>
            <para>
            The first web sample authenticates client in Gmail IMAP via OpenID + OAuth authentication.
            It has two pages: "Default.aspx" and "WebForm1.aspx". User opens "Default.aspx" and
            is get redirected to OpenID server page on Google web site (where the user can grant access to their data to your application).
            Then, Google redirects the user's browser to "WebForm1.aspx" which actually accesses the user's e-mail account via IMAP.</para>
            <para><i>"http://[yourhost]/hybrid/WebForm1.aspx"</i> designates the URL of "WebForm1.aspx" page (so that Google would know
            where it should redirect the user after passing the authorization stage).</para>
            <para>If user sets "Remember this approval" checkbox on Google authentication page, next time
            Google will not ask to allow site request for getting Gmail access rights and will get access
            by default. GMail XOAuth key also may be stored by application for logging in GMail without authentication process.

            <remarks>Due to distributed nature of Internet domains database, DNS servers are usually capable of
            immediate lookup of DNS records only for a limited subset of Internet domains. In order to lookup
            DNS records for domains belonging to external networks, a DNS server must be capable of DNS recursion
            which is a process of querying DNS server of higher level in the case when the current DNS server cannot find the
            requested resource in its local database. If the DNS server does not support recursion, it's
            practically useless since such server can serve only very restricted set of domains.</remarks>

            This error may occur if the server returns data very slowly. This is different from regular timeout errors
            which occur when the server never responds during certain time interval. For instance, if the regular timeout is 30 seconds,
            this means the server may return 1 byte of data each 25 seconds and this will never cause MailBee to claim timeout (even if the overall
            operation takes very long).

            <para>When making DNS MX lookup queries, it's normal that the DNS server does not

            time. If the second (or <i>n-th</i>, if <see cref="P:MailBee.DnsMX.DnsServer.UdpRetryCount"/> is <i>n</i>) attempt fails too, the DNS server is put aside (set in quarantine)
            and another DNS server is tried (however, if no more servers available, an error occurs).
            The amount of time the DNS server spends in quarantine is set by <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.DnsNextAttemptInterval"/> field.
            Once this time is over, the DNS server is returned back to the working servers set,
            and can be used again. If the DNS server again did not responded to two (or <i>n</i>) queries
            one by one, it's set in quarantine again. When the number of settings in quarantine
            is going to reach <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.DnsMaxFailureCount"/>, the server is considered completely down,
            and will not be tried any longer (or at least until the application explicitly calls

            use secure methods and downgrades to non-secure ones only if secure methods are not available.
            In <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.SafeMode"/>, this behavior is reversed. However, if the list of desired methods
            is limited to secure methods only (for instance, <see cref="M:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.Login(System.String,System.String,MailBee.AuthenticationMethods)"/>
            was called with <i>authMethods</i> parameter set to <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationMethods.Apop"/>),
            MailBee will NOT attempt to use non-secure methods even in safe mode.</para>
            <para>Setting <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.SafeMode"/> to <b>true</b> changes the defaults as follows:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>Pipelining is disabled (<see cref="P:MailBee.Global.Pipelining"/> will return <b>false</b>)</description></item>
            <item><description><see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.PreferSimpleMethods"/> is enabled</description></item>
            <item><description>All ESMTP extensions except AUTH (SMTP authentication) are disabled (<see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.SmtpOptions"/> is 7)</description></item>
            </list>
            </para>
            <note>
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.SafeMode"/> property specifies defaults only for newly created connection settings objects.
            Thus, it must be set BEFORE creating instances of MailBee classes which are containers of the
            connection settings (i.e. <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer"/>). The property value does not have any effect on
            <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer"/> objects already created.
            </note>
            <para>However, even if certain connection settings object was created AFTER <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.SafeMode"/> property had already
            been set, its effect can be overridden using such object's properties or method parameters which explicitly
            control the corresponding options. For instance, the developer may manually change
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.SmtpOptions"/> value after it was set during construction
            of the object.</para>
            <para>Note that in Visual Basic you need to use the fully qualified name when accessing this property.
            Use <c>MailBee.Global.SafeMode</c>, not <c>Global.SafeMode</c>.
            This is because <c>Global</c> is a keyword in VB.</para>

            <para>By default, MailBee does not use weak algorithms like MD5 and RC4 (even if <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> is <b>false</b>) and uses
            stronger methods like SHA1 instead (this concerns S/MIME, SSL, digests of Message-ID hashes, etc). However, there are things which
            can only be implemented via MD5. They include <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationMethods.Apop"/>, <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationMethods.SaslCramMD5"/>, <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationMethods.SaslDigestMD5"/>
            authentication methods. When <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> is enabled, MailBee will never use these methods even if they are supported by the mail server.</para>
            <para><see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> also affects how SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms are used with <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys"/>. In FIPS mode, MailBee will pick FIPS-compliant
            implementations of these algorithms instead of their managed code counterparts (managed code versions are faster but not FIPS-compliant). If <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> is NOT enabled and
            the current system is FIPS-compliant, MailBee will try a non-FIPS method first. It will fail with an exception, MailBee will catch that exception and fall back to a FIPS method.
            Enabling <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> avoids penalty of trying the method which will fail anyway.</para>
            <para>SSL and S/MIME functions of MailBee are by default immune to FIPS restrictions and use FIPS-compliant methods.</para>
            <note>If the current system if FIPS-enabled and you didn't set <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> to <b>true</b>, you may get <see cref="T:System.InvalidOperationException"/> exceptions and related errors
            (mostly, with MD5-based authentication mechanisms). This is because .NET Framework will block MailBee's attempts to create instances of FIPS-noncompliant classes.</note>

            Sometimes, however, if you have an existing message with no quoted-printable or base64 encoding and with lengthy lines, you may need to increase this value
            if you want to keep its formatting (avoid adding extra line breaks) after re-sending.</para>
            <note>Having lines with more than 76 chars is MIME standards violation. When making new messages, you should
            avoid chaning the default value of this property unless you have a very good reason for this. Again, by default
            MailBee utilizes quoted-printable encoding to transparently wrap lines without any extra line breaks. You should

            (created with <see cref="M:MailBee.Html.RuleSet.AddTagProcessingCondition(System.String,MailBee.Html.TagAttributeCollection)"/> method). See <see cref="M:MailBee.Html.RuleSet.AddTagProcessingCondition(System.String,MailBee.Html.TagAttributeCollection)"/> topic for the details
            which apply to the HTML processing rules of all types.</para>
            <para>The action for this rule replaces the matching tag either completely (<see cref="P:MailBee.Html.Element.OuterHtml"/> gets replaced)
            or partially (only <see cref="P:MailBee.Html.Element.TagDefinition"/> gets replaced) depending on <paramref name="replaceTagDefinitionOnly"/> value.
            If <paramref name="replaceTagDefinitionOnly"/> is <b>true</b>, this rule simply renames the matching tags removing the original name and attributes with
            supplied ones while leaving <see cref="P:MailBee.Html.Element.InnerHtml"/> intact.</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            This sample replaces BR tag definitions with HR tag definitions.

            <remarks>
            <para>This delegate defines a pattern for the callback method MailBee executes when it encounters
            any matches of HTML processing rule conditions with particular HTML elements. You can implement any
            custom processing in this method, modify the given HTML element, or decide whether the rule should be applied
            by returning <b>true</b> of <b>false</b>.</para>
            <para><see cref="M:MailBee.Html.Element.Process(MailBee.Html.RuleSet,MailBee.Html.ProcessElementDelegate)"/> method, while being running, executes a delegate method every
            time when any of the rules gets satisfied. This happens when the rule condition matches a particular
            HTML tag (for instance, you're using a rule which applies to all &lt;A&gt; tags with HREF attributes and
            <see cref="M:MailBee.Html.Element.Process(MailBee.Html.RuleSet,MailBee.Html.ProcessElementDelegate)"/> method encountered such a tag).</para>
            <para><see cref="M:MailBee.Html.Element.Process(MailBee.Html.RuleSet,MailBee.Html.ProcessElementDelegate)"/> method then executes the delegate passing a reference to the matching
            <see cref="T:MailBee.Html.Element"/>. The delegate method should examine the supplied element and return either <b>true</b>
            to let MailBee apply the rule action to this element or <b>false</b> to ignore it.
            The return value of the delegate, however, does not affect whether <see cref="M:MailBee.Html.Element.Process(MailBee.Html.RuleSet,MailBee.Html.ProcessElementDelegate)"/> method will
            continue processing of subsequent elements of the document. To make <see cref="M:MailBee.Html.Element.Process(MailBee.Html.RuleSet,MailBee.Html.ProcessElementDelegate)"/> method completely stop processing
            of the current document, call <see cref="M:MailBee.Html.Element.Stop"/> method for the same object
            you earlier called <see cref="M:MailBee.Html.Element.Process(MailBee.Html.RuleSet,MailBee.Html.ProcessElementDelegate)"/> for.</para>
            <para>Rules of all types (defined in <see cref="T:MailBee.Html.TagRuleTypes"/> enumeration) cause the delegate be executed. Moreover,

            Represents an IMAP4 envelope of a mail message (including any other related information
            such as body structure, message flags, the mail message itself, etc).
            <seealso cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/>
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>An instance of this class represents the information about the mail message returned by the IMAP4 server
            in a single FETCH response. This may contain information about an IMAP4 envelope (which is a collection
            of common properties of a mail message such as "Subject:", "From:", "To:", etc), a body structure of the mail
            message, the mail message itself, its flags, ordinal message number, UID, and size, the date when the message was received by the IMAP4 server,
            and other message attributes including user-specified ones.</para>
            <para>MailBee allows the developer to specify which attributes/parts of mail messages must be downloaded resulting in a greater
            flexibility and smaller network traffic (unnecessary items are not downloaded).</para>
            <para>All methods of <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap"/> object which return <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> or
            <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessageCollection"/> objects actually download envelopes and then extract mail messages from <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.MessagePreview"/>
            property of <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> object.</para>
            <note>Due to complexity of the IMAP4 protocol, many IMAP4 server implementations cannot always produce
            correct FETCH responses. If MailBee detects the particular FETCH response cannot be parsed,
            it raises <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.ErrorOccurred"/> event for this response, and sets <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.IsValid"/> property
            for the corresponding response to <b>false</b>. No exception is thrown, however.</note>
            Most fields of the envelope may be missing (if they were not requested from the server or they are missing in the message itself).
            For instance, if the message has no subject,
            <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.Subject"/> property may return a null reference (<b>Nothing</b> in Visual Basic). To make using
            <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> object easier, MailBee returns empty values instead of null references by default.
            To force MailBee return a null reference for a missing field, the developer should set <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.SafeMode"/> to <b>false</b>.
            </remarks>
            <example>
            This sample downloads essential information about the messages in the inbox (such as IMAP4 envelope,
            date of receiving by the server, flags, and size), and its body structure. The messages themselves are not downloaded.
            The body structure information is used to count attachments of the message (this approach is more reliable than downloading
            message header and relying on <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.HasAttachments"/> property which might not be 100% correct).
            To notify user about particular envelopes which cannot be parsed, <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.ErrorOccurred"/> event handler is used.

            <para>
            This method can return objects of many different types depending on whether the specified item
            is predefined and whether it's a list of sub-items or a single item. In particular, if certain
            item is predefined (such as <i>BODYSTRUCTURE</i>, <i>UID</i>, <i>FLAGS</i>, <i>RFC822.SIZE</i>, etc) the corresponding
            object or value type will be returned (such as <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapBodyStructure"/>, <see cref="T:System.Int64"/>,
            <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.MessageFlagSet"/>, <see cref="T:System.Int32"/>, etc).
            </para>
            <para>
            If <paramref name="name"/> is not recognized, the method returns <see cref="T:System.Collections.ArrayList"/>
            object if the item is a list of sub-items, or byte[]/string depending on <paramref name="stringsAsBytes"/> value.
            In the case if <see cref="T:System.Collections.ArrayList"/> is returned, its sub-items will conform the same rule:
            if sub-item is a list, it will be returned as <see cref="T:System.Collections.ArrayList"/>, otherwise, byte[] or string.
            Thus, <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.GetEnvelopeItem(System.String,System.Boolean)"/> method allows the developer to examine both simple FETCH items and complex
            nested structures with unlimited depth of hierarchy.
            </para>
            <para>
            The common use of setting <paramref name="stringsAsBytes"/> to <b>true</b> is when the application
            needs the item data as byte array. Otherwise, the developer should set <paramref name="stringsAsBytes"/> to <b>false</b>.
            </para>
            <para>The developer can use this method to obtain user-specified items of the FETCH response
            (for instance, the common use is getting certain MIME part of the message). To have the particular
            item listed in the FETCH response, the developer should first specify its key in <i>extraItems</i>
            parameter of <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> method.</para>
            <para>If you need to extract different items for different e-mails, you can either call <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> method multiple times specifying
            different items each time or use <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopesEx(System.Int64[],System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts[],System.Int32[],System.String[][],System.String[][])"/> method. <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopesEx(System.Int64[],System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts[],System.Int32[],System.String[][],System.String[][])"/> is faster as it
            executes as a single command (pipelining mode). The difference is especially noticable if you download many small items.</para>
            <note>Keys to be specified in <i>extraItems</i> parameters of <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> method
            can be different from their corresponding item names in FETCH responses. For instance,
            if <i>BODY.PEEK[1]</i> was requested, its name in the FETCH response would be <i>BODY[1]</i>.
            See IMAP4 protocol specification (RFC3501) for more information regarding FETCH requests and responses.</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>
            This sample completely downloads all image files attached or embedded into the last message in the inbox,
            and saves them into C:\Temp folder. The IMAP4 server is queried twice: first, we download the body structure
            of the message to learn which parts as images, and then we download these parts. The entire message itself
            is not downloaded.
            </para>
            <para>To demonstrate that key names in FETCH requests and FETCH responses can be different,
            this sample downloads images in read-only mode (BODY.PEEK is used instead of BODY). Thus, running
            this sample won't cause the server to set "\Seen" flag for the message.</para>
            <para>This sample can extract items for one message per command  If you want to use it with multiple messages, see
            more advanced samples in <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopesEx(System.Int64[],System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts[],System.Int32[],System.String[][],System.String[][])"/> and <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.BeginDownloadEnvelopesEx(System.Int64[],System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts[],System.Int32[],System.String[][],System.String[][],System.AsyncCallback,System.Object)"/> topics.

            For instance, this method can be used to optimize deleting of folders with their subfolders. Because
            it's not usually permitted to delete a folder which contains subfolders, these subfolders must be removed first.
            However, mail servers usually place subfolders after their parent folders in the returned folder list. Thus,
            it's more efficient to iterate through this collection in descending order, removing subfolders first and their parent folders last.
            See <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DeleteFolder(System.String)"/> topic for the sample code.

            <para>
            Quotas provide the convenient way of determining the maximum and used size of account/folder storage.
            To obtain quotas, the developer can use <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetAccountQuota"/> or <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetFolderQuota(System.String)"/> methods.
            </para>
            <para>
            However, the IMAP4 server must support QUOTA capability in order to take advantage of quotas.
            The developer may check if the server supports QUOTA using <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetExtension(System.String)"/> method
            passing "QUOTA" as <i>name</i> parameter value. See <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetAccountQuota"/> topic for

            MailBee uses this method to raise <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Connected"/> event. In WinForms application,
            the event will be raised on the message loop thread. In other applications (such as
            web or console applications), threading is not a concern, and the current thread
            MailBee is running on will be used.</para>
            <para>You can override this method in a derived class to force MailBee execute your own code
            instead of raising <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Connected"/> event. This may help to avoid threading issues
            in WinForms applications (because events may not be raised if the message loop thread
            is blocked for some reason, while calling overridden methods does not depend on the message
            loop thread state).</para>
            <para>Another solution of this problem is setting <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.RaiseEventsViaMessageLoop"/> to <b>false</b>
            and using <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Wait"/> method to block the message loop thread if needed. This way, you do not need

            <para>By default, MailBee won't even try to use authentication methods which are not

            <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.TryUnsupportedMethods"/> bit in <paramref name="authOptions"/>.
            If, during the authentication attempt, the server reports that the method is unsupported,
            MailBee will try the next method in <paramref name="authMethods"/> until the compatible
            method is found or no more methods left. This behavior can be changed by setting
            <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.UseSingleMethodOnly"/> bit in <paramref name="authOptions"/>.</para>
            <para>Authentication methods are tried from more secure to less secure. If <paramref name="authMethods"/>
            is set to <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationMethods.Auto"/> and <paramref name="authOptions"/> is
            <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationOptions.None"/>, MailBee will try to use the most secure method
            supported by the server but will downgrade to less secure methods (to the simplest
            "LOGIN account password" authentication in the worst case) if better methods are not available.
            However, if the IMAP4 server prohibits using LOGIN command (LOGINDISABLED extension is enabled),
            regular authentication option won't be available.</para>

            <example>This sample connects to an IMAP4 server and attempts to log in a user account
            using SASL NTLM method in Integrated Windows Authentication mode (passing credentials of the currently logged Windows user) even if
            NTLM is not listed in the server capabilities (the server may still support NTLM while not advertising this).
            Use of other authentication methods is not allowed by this sample (they do not support obtaining
            the current Windows user's credentials and thus will raise exception is empty credentials are supplied by the caller).

            <para>This overload can be used to expunge the specified messages only. Often, it's required to remove certain message
            from the folder but leave other messages marked as deleted intact. The standard IMAP4 protocol does not allow this to be done but
            if the server supports UIDPLUS extension, it becomes possible (via UID EXPUNGE command).
            </para>
            <para>This method always issues EXPUNGE if <paramref name="uidSet"/> is not set. If <paramref name="uidSet"/> is not a null reference,
            the method will attempt to delete the messages having UIDs from <paramref name="uidSet"/> list and \Deleted flag set. If, however,
            UIDPLUS is not supported, the method will either simulate effect of UID EXPUNGE using a number of regular IMAP4 commands
            (if <paramref name="forceUidExpunge"/> is <b>false</b>)
            or report error and do not expunge any messages (if <paramref name="forceUidExpunge"/> is <b>true</b>).</para>
            <para>In most cases, it's ok to set <paramref name="forceUidExpunge"/> to <b>false</b>. The only reason for not doing so is
            when the component is used with the IMAP folder where messages are added very often by another clients. In this case, while the component
            executes a sequence of commands to expunge certain messages, another mail client can add, remove, or manage messages in the same folder.
            In this case, the folder state may go out of sync. In all other cases, if no other mail agents access the same folder at the same time,
            it's safe to use MailBee simulation of UID EXPUNGE command when it's not supported by the server.

            <para>
            This overload is the encapsulation of LIST and LSUB commands of the IMAP4 protocol described in RFC3501. It also supports XLIST command which can be used
            to get well-known folder flags like Sent, Drafts or Spam (Gmail and SPECIAL-USE capable servers can also support these flags
            with regular LIST/LSUB commands, see <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UseXList"/> topic for details).
            <paramref name="parentFolderName"/> parameter corresponds to 'reference name' argument of LIST/LSUB command,
            and <paramref name="pattern"/> parameter corresponds to 'mailbox name' argument.
            </para>
            <para>If <paramref name="parentFolderName"/> is null, 'reference name' will be empty string.</para>
            <para>If <paramref name="pattern"/> is null, 'mailbox name' will be "*" wildcard.</para>
            <para><paramref name="parentFolderName"/> specifies the root to returns subfolders for.</para>
            <para>"*" wildcard used as <paramref name="pattern"/> means all folders including subfolders of the given root. "%" wildcard
            will force the server to return only immediate subfolders of the given root, without their own subfolders. Wildcards can appear in patterns multiple times
            (see <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.BeginDownloadFolders(System.Boolean,System.String,System.String,System.AsyncCallback,System.Object)"/> topic for the sample code).</para>
            <para>The developer can refer to RFC3501 to find the further information regarding listing folders.</para>
            <para>
            This method fully supports international folder names in both <paramref name="parentFolderName"/> and <paramref name="pattern"/> parameters.
            </para>
            <para>If your IMAP server supports CHILDREN extension (most servers do), <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.FolderFlags.HasChildren"/> and <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.FolderFlags.HasNoChildren"/> flags make it
            easier to build the nested list of folders in case if you have too many folders to get them at once. E.g. you may get only one level
            and show [+] controls for folders having sub-folders. Without CHILDREN extension you'd have to download the second level of folders just to
            determine if the first level folders have subfolders or not.</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>
            This sample downloads the list of Inbox's immediate subfolders (without sub-sub-folders) having names starting with "Order".
            Thus, "Inbox/Orders", "Inbox/Order", "Inbox/Orders April 2006" will be listed while "Orders", "Inbox/Other", "Inbox/Orders April 2006/29" will not.
            </para>
            <para>In this description, it's assumed "/" character is a delimiter of folder levels (some servers may use another delimiter, such as ".").
            However, the sample code correctly determines the delimiter and does not rely on assumption that the delimiter is "/".

            When multiple keys are specified, the result is the intersection (AND function) of all the messages that match those keys. For example,

            since February 1, 1994.  A search key can also be a parenthesized list of one or more search keys (e.g., for use with the OR and NOT keys).

            <para>When passing strings to search query, you should use the syntax like <c>"TEXT " + ImapUtils.ToQuotedString(textToSearch)</c> to enclose the text string in quotes.

            &lt;string&gt; means a quoted string (like <i>"Annual report"</i> or <i>"String with quote \" and backslash \\ inside"</i>). Certain
            key arguments specifying numbers (like <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>) must not be quoted.
            <para>Dates must be written in IMAP4 format and enclosed with quotes. Example: <i>"06-Apr-2006"</i>.
            See the sample code in <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.BeginSearch(System.Boolean,System.String,System.String,System.AsyncCallback,System.Object)"/> topic on how to perform search by date.</para>
            Angle brackets (i.e. <i>&lt;&gt;</i> in <i>&lt;string&gt;</i>) only indicate placeholder for
            actual value, they are not actually a part of the key. For instance, <i>TO &lt;string&gt;</i> means the actual key will look like <i>TO "jdoe@domain.com"</i>.
            </para>
            <note>Although searching is case-insensitive, some server implementations cannot perform search of strings containing
            international characters in case-insensitive manner even if the correct <paramref name="charset"/> value is specified.
            Also, most IMAP server implementations cannot find searched string when it appears in the message in encoded form
            (such as Base64, quoted-printable, etc). Due to this, text search via IMAP4 is not as reliable as downloading entire messages
            and performing search over local copies.</note>
            <para>If you are using <b>Gmail</b> and perform search of international text in non-ASCII charset (e.g. UTF-8),
            use <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapUtils.ToLiteral(System.String)"/> method instead of <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapUtils.ToQuotedString(System.String)"/>.
            <b>Gmail does not support non-ASCII data in quoted strings.</b> See <a href="getting_started_with_imap_pop3.html#GmailIssues">Gmail IMAP and POP3 issues</a>
            topic on how to build search queries with <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapUtils.ToLiteral(System.String)"/> method.</para>
            <para>With Gmail, however, you have an option to use extended syntax of Gmail search. It supports non-ASCII as well. See <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapUtils.GmailSearch(System.String)"/> for details.</para>
            <para>Also, you can search for Gmail labels assigned to messages using <b>X-GM-LABELS</b> verb. For instance: <c>imap.Search(true, ImapUtils.AnyOf(@"X-GM-LABELS label1", @"X-GM-LABELS sent"), null)</c> (in C# syntax). This
            returns UIDs of all e-mails which have "label1" or "sent" labels set.</para>
            <note>MS Exchange (including Office 365) can search ASCII only. You cannot search for international content there. You can switch to Exchange Web Services (<see cref="!:MailBee.EwsMail.Ews"/>) when working with MS Exchange.</note>

            <para>Sorting is in ascending order. Earlier dates sort before later dates; smaller sizes sort before larger sizes; and strings are sorted according to ascending values established by their collation algorithm.</para>
            <para>To sort in descending order (e.g. "newer first"), prepend the sorting key with <i>REVERSE</i> (e.g. <i>REVERSE ARRIVAL</i>.</para>
            <para>If two or more messages exactly match according to the sorting criteria, these messages are sorted according to the order in which they appear in the mailbox. In other words, there is an implicit sort criterion of "sequence number".</para>
            <para>When multiple sort criteria are specified, the result is sorted in the priority order that the criteria appear. For example, "SUBJECT DATE" will sort messages in order by their base subject text; and for messages with the same base subject text will sort by their sent date.</para>
            <para>If the associated message header for a particular criterion is absent in the message, it is treated as the empty string. The empty string always collates before non-empty strings.</para>

            <para>Ordinal message numbers and UIDs are one-based (minimum value is 1, not 0). However, the returned <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeCollection"/> is zero-based.
            The developer can use <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.MessageNumber"/> or <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.Uid"/> properties to obtain ordinal message numbers and UIDs of the downloaded
            envelopes.</para>
            <para>
            To specify multiple message numbers or UIDs in <paramref name="messageIndexSet"/>, delimit them with comma (,) or use ranges (such as "5:10" which means "download messages in the range
            from message #5 to the message #10"). Wildcard character (*), can be used to specify range which spans till the last message in the folder. In particular, "1:*" means "download all messages in the folder".
            "1:*" is also declared as <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.AllMessages"/> constant.
            </para>
            <para>Examples of valid message sequences: "1", "1:*", "1,2", "1:2", "5:10,12:45,99,101,105,141:*".</para>
            <note>A message sequence string may NOT contain whitespaces. The following is INCORRECT: "1, 2, 5". The correct one is: "1,2,5".</note>
            <para>When using a range of UIDs (<paramref name="indexIsUid"/> is <b>true</b>), it's important to understand the number of returned messages
            may be LESS than the length of the range (or even zero). This is because UIDs are not continuous. For instance, if the folder contains messages
            with UIDs 4, 5, 6, 10, and 22, the "1,2,8:20" sequence of UIDs corresponds to a single message with UID=10.</para>
            <para>
            <paramref name="parts"/> parameters can be used to specify which message elements to download. This allows the developer
            to request only required information from the server and thus reduce network traffic by not downloading unnecessary data.
            </para>
            <note>If certain message element, attribute, or group of elements/attributes is not requested from the server, the developer should not attempt
            to read the corresponding properties of <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> objects within the returned collection. For instance, if <paramref name="parts"/> didn't contain
            <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.Envelope"/> (or <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.MailBeeEnvelope"/>, which is a superset of <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.Envelope"/>),
            <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.From"/>, <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.To"/>, <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.Subject"/>, and some other properties will not return useful information.
            See remarks in <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts"/> topic for more information on dependencies
            between downloaded parts of FETCH response and related properties of <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> object.</note>
            <para>
            <paramref name="bodyPreviewSize"/> parameter makes sense only when <paramref name="parts"/> includes <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.MessagePreview"/> flag.
            When <paramref name="bodyPreviewSize"/> is 0, the component will download only header section of each message (accessible via <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.MessagePreview"/> property).
            If <paramref name="bodyPreviewSize"/> is larger than 0, the component will download the header and the specified count of bytes of the body.
            If <paramref name="bodyPreviewSize"/> is -1 or -2, the entire message is returned (-2 will keep UNSEEN status). Methods like <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEntireMessage(System.Int64,System.Boolean)"/> or <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadMessageHeaders(System.String,System.Boolean)"/>
            simply call <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> inside and then return <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.MessagePreview"/> values.
            </para>
            <para>
            <paramref name="extraHeaders"/> can be used to request certain additional header fields
            which are not included into ENVELOPE item of FETCH response
            and thus not present in <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> object properties. Alternatively, the developer may request
            downloading the message header by setting <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.MessagePreview"/> flag in <paramref name="parts"/>.
            Thus, all header fields would be downloaded. However, if the developer wants to reduce traffic and do not download
            entire header sections of messages, <paramref name="extraHeaders"/> should be used to retrieve specific header fields.
            The typical usage of <paramref name="extraHeaders"/> is getting "Importance" or "X-Priority" headers.
            </para>
            <para>
            Values specified in <paramref name="extraItems"/> are passed to the IMAP4 server without alteration. Using <paramref name="extraItems"/>,
            the developer can request any valid FETCH item from the server (for instance, the developer may request downloading the contents of certain attachment
            or text body part of the message via its <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapBodyStructure.PartID"/>). The downloaded items can than
            be obtained via <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.GetEnvelopeItem(System.String,System.Boolean)"/> method call.
            </para>
            <para>When using <paramref name="extraItems"/>, it's important to remember that item names in FETCH request
            can be different from their counterparts in the corresponding FETCH response. E.g. if requested item name is "BODY.PEEK[3.HEADER]&lt;0.100&gt;",
            the server will return "BODY[3.HEADER]&lt;0&gt;" name in the response. The developer may refer to the IMAP4
            protocol specification (RFC3501) for more information regarding FETCH requests and responses.</para>
            <note>Due to complexity of IMAP4 responses, some servers may return badly formed FETCH responses under certain circumstances.
            If MailBee detects this, it raises <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.ErrorOccurred"/> event and sets <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.IsValid"/> to <b>false</b>.
            Since this is done on per-envelope basis, some <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> objects in the returned collection may have
            <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.IsValid"/> set to <b>false</b> while others - to <b>true</b>. Anyway, the component does not throw exception
            when it encounters invalid envelope. This allows the application to skip invalid response and successfully receive subsequent messages.</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>
            This sample downloads "X-Priority" and "X-MS-Mail-Priority" header fields for all messages in Inbox, then finds out which messages have High priority,
            and downloads body structures for these messages. From the body structures, the sample code obtains which messages have attachments. Then, these
            messages are completely downloaded, and all attachments are saved into "C:\Temp" folder.
            </para>
            <para>The sample performs search of high priority messages via downloading headers just to highlight how to download
            custom headers. In real world, it's more effective to use <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Search(System.Boolean,System.String,System.String)"/> method for this. The sample allows the developer
            to change code path to using <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Search(System.Boolean,System.String,System.String)"/> via setting <c>searchViaEnvelopes</c> variable value to <b>false</b>.</para>
            <para>The sample also keeps track of invalid IMAP responses in <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.ErrorOccurred"/> event handler.</para>

            <remarks>
            <para>Use this method if you want to download different elements for different messages and would like to have the entire operation complete
            as a single command (pipelined batch). Typical cases for that are downloading text bodies or certain types of attachments from multiple messages.
            For other cases (when you need the same items for all messages, like envelope, header, full message, etc), use <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> method or its overloads.</para>
            <para>The main advantage of <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopesEx(System.Int64[],System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts[],System.Int32[],System.String[][],System.String[][])"/> method is speed. You can do the same calling <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> multiple times
            (one call per message) each time requesting different message items. <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopesEx(System.Int64[],System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts[],System.Int32[],System.String[][],System.String[][])"/> just makes it possible to send all the requests at once
            and thus save time on multiple round-trips FETCH requests to the server and FETCH responses back from it. If performance is not a concern,
            use <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/>. See <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.GetEnvelopeItem(System.String,System.Boolean)"/> for example.</para>
            <para>Usually, <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopesEx(System.Int64[],System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts[],System.Int32[],System.String[][],System.String[][])"/> method is used after <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> which requested body structures of the messages. Then you code analyzes these
            body structures, composes FETCH requests and the expected items in FETCH responses, and supplies the collected information to
            <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopesEx(System.Int64[],System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts[],System.Int32[],System.String[][],System.String[][])"/> method.</para>

            the length of the message body section (in bytes) to be downloaded in addition to the message header section; if 0, only the message header
            is downloaded; if -1 or -2, the entire message is downloaded. -1 is the only option which also sets Seen flag marking the message as read.</param>

            <remarks>
            <para>Ordinal message numbers and UIDs are one-based (minimum value is 1, not 0). However, the returned <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeCollection"/> is zero-based.
            The developer can use <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.MessageNumber"/> or <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.Uid"/> properties to obtain ordinal message numbers and UIDs of the downloaded
            envelopes.</para>
            <para>
            To specify multiple message numbers or UIDs in <paramref name="messageIndexSet"/>, delimit them with comma (,) or use ranges (such as "5:10" which means "download messages in the range
            from message #5 to the message #10"). Wildcard character (*), can be used to specify range which spans till the last message in the folder. In particular, "1:*" means "download all messages in the folder".
            "1:*" is also declared as <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.AllMessages"/> constant.
            </para>
            <para>Examples of valid message sequences: "1", "1:*", "1,2", "1:2", "5:10,12:45,99,101,105,141:*".</para>
            <note>A message sequence string may NOT contain whitespaces. The following is INCORRECT: "1, 2, 5". The correct one is: "1,2,5".</note>
            <para>When using a range of UIDs (<paramref name="indexIsUid"/> is <b>true</b>), it's important to understand the number of returned messages
            may be LESS than the length of the range (or even zero). This is because UIDs are not continuous. For instance, if the folder contains messages
            with UIDs 4, 5, 6, 10, and 22, the "1,2,8:20" sequence of UIDs corresponds to a single message with UID=10.</para>
            <para>
            <paramref name="parts"/> parameters can be used to specify which message elements to download. This allows the developer
            to request only required information from the server and thus reduce network traffic by not downloading unnecessary data.
            </para>
            <note>If certain message element, attribute, or group of elements/attributes is not requested from the server, the developer should not attempt
            to read the corresponding properties of <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> objects within the returned collection. For instance, if <paramref name="parts"/> didn't contain
            <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.Envelope"/> (or <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.MailBeeEnvelope"/>, which is a superset of <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.Envelope"/>),
            <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.From"/>, <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.To"/>, <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.Subject"/>, and some other properties will not return useful information.
            See remarks in <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts"/> topic for more information on dependencies
            between downloaded parts of FETCH response and related properties of <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> object.</note>
            <para>
            <paramref name="bodyPreviewSize"/> parameter makes sense only when <paramref name="parts"/> includes <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.MessagePreview"/> flag.
            When <paramref name="bodyPreviewSize"/> is 0, the component will download only header section of each message (accessible via <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.MessagePreview"/> property).
            If <paramref name="bodyPreviewSize"/> is larger than 0, the component will download the header and the specified count of bytes of the body.
            If <paramref name="bodyPreviewSize"/> is -1 or -2, the entire message is returned (-2 will keep UNSEEN status). Methods like <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEntireMessage(System.Int64,System.Boolean)"/> or <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadMessageHeaders(System.String,System.Boolean)"/>
            simply call <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> inside and then return <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.MessagePreview"/> values.
            </para>
            <note>Due to complexity of IMAP4 responses, some servers may return badly formed FETCH responses under certain circumstances.
            If MailBee detects this, it raises <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.ErrorOccurred"/> event and sets <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.IsValid"/> to <b>false</b>.
            Since this is done on per-envelope basis, some <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> objects in the returned collection may have
            <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.IsValid"/> set to <b>false</b> while others - to <b>true</b>. Anyway, the component does not throw exception
            when it encounters invalid envelope. This allows the application to skip invalid response and successfully receive subsequent messages.</note>

            <remarks>
            <para>Ordinal message numbers and UIDs are one-based (minimum value is 1, not 0). However, the returned <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeCollection"/> is zero-based.
            The developer can use <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.MessageNumber"/> or <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.Uid"/> properties to obtain ordinal message numbers and UIDs of the downloaded
            envelopes.</para>
            <para>
            To specify multiple message numbers or UIDs in <paramref name="messageIndexSet"/>, delimit them with comma (,) or use ranges (such as "5:10" which means "download messages in the range
            from message #5 to the message #10"). Wildcard character (*), can be used to specify range which spans till the last message in the folder. In particular, "1:*" means "download all messages in the folder".
            "1:*" is also declared as <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.AllMessages"/> constant.
            </para>
            <para>Examples of valid message sequences: "1", "1:*", "1,2", "1:2", "5:10,12:45,99,101,105,141:*".</para>
            <note>A message sequence string may NOT contain whitespaces. The following is INCORRECT: "1, 2, 5". The correct one is: "1,2,5".</note>
            <para>When using a range of UIDs (<paramref name="indexIsUid"/> is <b>true</b>), it's important to understand the number of returned messages
            may be LESS than the length of the range (or even zero). This is because UIDs are not continuous. For instance, if the folder contains messages
            with UIDs 4, 5, 6, 10, and 22, the "1,2,8:20" sequence of UIDs corresponds to a single message with UID=10.</para>
            <para>
            <para>This method fetches the following items from the IMAP server: UID, FLAGS, INTERNALDATE, RFC822SIZE, ENVELOPE. To get additional information about messages
            (for instance, a body structure, non-standard header fields, attachments, a message header section, etc), the developer should use other overloads of this method.</para>
            </para>
            <note>Due to complexity of IMAP4 responses, some servers may return badly formed FETCH responses under certain circumstances.
            If MailBee detects this, it raises <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.ErrorOccurred"/> event and sets <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.IsValid"/> to <b>false</b>.
            Since this is done on per-envelope basis, some <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> objects in the returned collection may have
            <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.IsValid"/> set to <b>false</b> while others - to <b>true</b>. Anyway, the component does not throw exception
            when it encounters invalid envelope. This allows the application to skip invalid response and successfully receive subsequent messages.</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            For each message in the Inbox, this sample downloads and displays the envelope information: From, Reply-To, To, CC, Subject, the date
            when the message was originally composed, and the date when the message was received by the server.

            <example>This WinForms sample demonstrates asynchronous downloading of all new messages in the Inbox folder. The messages are downloaded completely
            (with attachments, text parts, etc) and saved into "C:\Temp" folder. The message flags are downloaded as well.
            For each message, the sample prints saved file name and flags into Output window (it's visible when the application
            is being run in debug mode).

            <para>This method will download all the message headers in a single network operation,
            which greatly increases performance and reduces network traffic. However, if the application needs message headers
            just to get common information about messages (From, To, Date, Subject, Size, etc), it's more
            efficient to use <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean)"/> method. Typically, IMAP4 ENVELOPE structure
            and related information is 200-400 bytes in size, while message header sections are usually larger 500 bytes.
            ENVELOPE structure, however, does not contain header fields which describe priority/importance of
            the message, attachments presence, etc. On other hand, the application may avoid downloading message header section and
            still obtain all the necessary information by requesting envelopes, body structures, and the required headers using
            <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> method.</para>
            <note>To track downloading headers, <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.EnvelopeDownloaded"/> event should be used.
            There is no <b>MessageDownloaded</b> event since mail messages are actually downloaded within envelopes.
            Once an envelope is downloaded, the mail message data is extracted from it.
            Generally speaking, <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadMessageHeaders(System.String,System.Boolean)"/> is a kind of overload of <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> method.

            If the application needs to calculate the total size of all messages in all folders of the mail account,
            it should use QUOTA extension (<see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetAccountQuota"/> method) and fall back to
            multiple <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetFolderSize"/> calls only if QUOTA is not supported. However, iterating through
            all the folders and downloading messages' sizes may take considerable amount of time. Also, it's not possible
            to determine sizes of non-selectable folders and sizes of folders themselves (without their contained messages)
            using non-QUOTA approach. Thus, the storage size obtained from <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetAccountQuota"/> is usually larger (by 1% or so)
            than the size determined via a series of <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.SelectFolder(System.String)"/> and <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetFolderSize"/> calls.
            <note><see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetFolderSize"/> method considers only messages belonging to the folder itself. If the folder contains any sub-folders,
            the sizes of messages in these subfolders will not be included into the returned value.</note>

            <example>This sample attempts to gets the size of the currently used account storage using QUOTA extension.
            If QUOTA is not supported by the server, the sample selects all selectable folders in the account one by another,

            <remarks>
            <para>IMAP4 namespaces (if supported by your mail server) define prefixes you need to prepend folder names with when accessing
            folders of certain type (like Shared or Other Users' folders). Personal folders usually
            have no prefix but this can be different sometimes (usually, when more than one group of personal folders
            is available). Anyway, MailBee returns prefixes for all types of namespaces.</para>
            <para>Typical prefixes most commonly used by mail servers are: "" (empty string) for Personal, "~" for Other Users',
            "~public/" or "#" for Shared folders. This way, when you use no prefix (empty string), you automatically use Personal folders.</para>
            <para>Of course, the server returns namespace information which is only relevant to the given mail user. For instance,
            if the currently logged mail user does not have permission to access any Other Users' or Shared folders,
            the server won't return any information for these types of namespaces, and the corresponding properties of
            the returned <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapNamespaceCollectionSet"/> object will be a null reference. This is not an error.</para>
            <note>It's not necessarily required to issue <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetNamespaces"/> command prior to selecting or other use of
            namespaces in folder names. If you already know the namespace without <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetNamespaces"/> call, you can immediately use
            that namespace in folder names.</note>
            <para>To make sure the server does support namespaces, it's recommended to check this with <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetExtension(System.String)"/> method
            passing NAMESPACE as a value, prior to calling <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetNamespaces"/>. If NAMESPACE is not supported, 
            this means only Personal folders are available, and the prefix is an empty string. Keep in mind that
            <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetExtension(System.String)"/> method doesn't make any extra requests to the IMAP server, therefore using
            it to check if the server supports any extension is always safe and won't degrade performance at all.</para>
            <para>Also, note that even if the server lists certain namespace in the returned value, it does not yet mean
            you can actually select folders in that namespace because there may be none (empty namespace without any folders which belong to it).
            On other hand, the currently logged user may have access rights to select certain folder of another account but
            the server may not indicate this in the returned namespace results. This is all up to the server to decide.
            See the sample code below on how to find out which public folders are actually available to the currently logged mail user.</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            This sample downloads the list of all namespaces available for the given IMAP account. Then, it checks if that list of namespaces
            includes any Public (also known as Shared) namespaces. If yes, it uses this namespace name to download the list of all folders
            in that Public namespace (if there is more than one Public namespace, the last in the Public list is being used). Then, the sample
            picks the first folder in the downloaded Public folders list, selects this folder and reports the number of messages in it.

            <para>This method implements APPEND command of the IMAP4 protocol.</para>
            <para>To upload a file, the developer can first load it into <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> object using <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.LoadMessage(System.String)"/>
            method, and then call <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UploadMessage(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,System.String,System.String,System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.UidPlusResult)"/> passing a reference to this <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> object. There is no extra overhead
            on parsing the message since <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.LoadMessage(System.String)"/> just reads a file into memory. The <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> won't parse the contained message unless the application
            starts accessing its properties or methods (so-called "lazy" model).</para>
            <para>To upload a mail message just sent using <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> component, the developer call <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UploadMessage(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,System.String,System.String,System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.UidPlusResult)"/> method passing
            a reference to the <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Message"/> property.</para>
            <para>To get standard message flags as string in IMAP4 format (e.g. "\Seen \Flagged"), the developer can use <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.MessageFlagSet.SystemFlagsToString(MailBee.ImapMail.SystemMessageFlags)"/> method.</para>
            <para>In addition to the flags specified by the application, the server also sets "\Recent" flag. Thus, the uploaded message will always have at least "\Recent" flag set.</para>
            <para>To get datetime string in IMAP4 format (e.g. "01-May-2004 05:26:59 -0600"), the developer can use <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapUtils.GetImapDateTimeString"/> method.</para>
            <para><paramref name="batchMode"/> value is ignored if the server does not support LITERAL+ extension. However, even if LITERAL+ is supported, the developer may still decide
            not to use batch mode if there is a risk that the server will reject the message due to its size. If this happens, the client will waste bandwidth transferring
            the entire message. If the client wouldn't have used the LITERAL+, this could have been avoided, because the server would have rejected the initial small request
            containing the length of the data to be uploaded, and thus second large request containing the actual message data would have never been sent. In general, however,
            if the application is not going to upload very large messages frequently, it's more effective to keep batch mode on.

            <para>Some servers claim they support UIDPLUS but in fact there is no UIDPLUS data in the response (of the data has incorrect format). <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.UidPlusResult.IsSupported"/> will still be <b>true</b>

            <example>This sample loads the mail message from a file, and then uploads it to the Inbox folder on the server specifying "12-Apr-2006 19:30:00 +0100"
            as date of receiving the message by the server (INTERNALDATE), and setting "\Seen" and "\Flagged" flags (the server will also set "\Recent" flag). Finally,
            the UID value assigned to the message is displayed in the console. If UIDPLUS extension is supported,
            it's used. Otherwise, the application obtains the UID value downloading the status of Inbox folder prior to making upload.

            This WinForms samples deletes the first message in the inbox folder of the mail account asynchronously (in a worker thread).
            The sample then expunges the deleted messages (the expunge is also performed in worker thread).</para>
            <para>
            The sample also demonstrates how to wait for asynchronous operation completion without
            blocking user interface of the application (the user can click buttons, move windows, etc) during
            the asynchronous processing. However, the sample does not allow the user to click a button which starts
            the asynchronous operation if this operation is already in progress.

            </para>
            <note>The IMAP4 protocol might not directly support moving messages between folders (unless the server supports MOVE extension).
            If MOVE command is not supported by the server, MailBee emulates moving messages
            as a sequence of copying, marking copied messages as deleted in the source folder, and then expunging deleted messages.
            This operation performs quicker when the server supports UIDPLUS extension (because UIDPLUS allows the client to expunge specific
            "\Deleted" messages rather than all such messages in the folder).
            If UIDPLUS is not supported, it takes a bit longer to move messages since MailBee needs to preserve messages which have already had "\Deleted" flag set
            to the moment when <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.MoveMessages(System.String,System.Boolean,System.String,MailBee.ImapMail.UidPlusResult)"/> method started. If MailBee just expunged the deleted messages from the folder,
            this would affect not only messages being copied but rather all messages which have already had "\Deleted" flag set.
            MailBee avoids this by temporary removing "\Deleted" flag from the messages which have already had this flag, and then restoring
            this flag back when the moving completes. However, when all messages in the folder are being moved, it's not required
            to care about remaining messages. Thus, when UIDPLUS is not supported, moving all messages is performed in less count of steps than moving
            specific messages only. Again, all of the above only makes sense when MOVE command is not supported. With MOVE command, moving messages is
            fast and straight-forward process.

            <para>Thus, the client should remember <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UidValidity"/> value of each folder and compare
            the saved value and new value on next session. If new value is larger, it means the mail server is
            not capable of keeping UIDs unchanged between sessions. In this case, the client cannot make any assumptions
            that UIDs obtained during the previous session correspond to UIDs of the same messages on this session.</para>
            <para>Nowadays, IMAP4 servers which fail to persist UIDs between session are very uncommon, and the UIDVALIDITY value is usually the same accross sessions.
            Nevertheless, the client should still check
            the UIDVALIDITY value due to the following reason: if, between two sessions, the folder was deleted and the folder with the same
            name was recreated, and this new folder was filled with some mails, their UIDs may coincide with UIDs
            of the messages in the original folder (which is now deleted). To avoid confusion,
            the application should check if UIDVALIDITY had changed.</para>

            <value>A 32-bit positive value containing the UIDNEXT of the currently selected folder,
            or 0 if it's not available or no folder is selected.</value>
            <remarks>
            This value, if available, allows the application to predict the UID value
            that will be assigned to a new message in the folder.
            <para>For instance, if the application is
            going to upload a message into the folder and wants to know the UID assigned to this message,
            it can obtain this information passing <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.UidPlusResult"/> object as <i>result</i>
            parameter of <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UploadMessage(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,System.String,System.String,System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.UidPlusResult)"/> method.</para>
            <para>However, if the server does not support UIDPLUS extension, this won't work.
            If the server lacks UIDPLUS support, the application can query <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UidNext"/>
            before making upload. If it's non-zero, this will be a value of UID to be assigned to the uploaded message.</para>
            <note><see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UidNext"/> value is updated ONLY when a folder gets selected. Thus, if any messages arrived
            into the folder after it was selected, <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UidNext"/> won't reflect the next UID value any longer.
            To request the current UIDNEXT value explicitly, the application should obtain the current <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.FolderStatus"/>
            of the folder using <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetFolderStatus(System.String)"/> method. This approach also has another advantage:
            some servers do not report UIDNEXT value on folder selection but they always report it when folder status is requested.

            <value>If <b>true</b>, MailBee will issue XLIST command instead of LIST when the application calls
            <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadFolders(System.Boolean,System.String,System.String)"/> method. If <b>false</b>, regular LIST command will be used (no flags denoting special folders will be available).
            The default value is <b>true</b> if the server supports XLIST.</value>
            <remarks>
            <para>Even if you set this property to <b>true</b>, it may still return <b>false</b> if the server does not support XLIST.
            Usually, you do not need to set it explicitly as MailBee will set it to <b>true</b>
            automatically if the server supports XLIST. MailBee reads the IMAP capabilities at the moment of connecting to the server (in some cases, it can re-read the capabilities
            later but this does not affect XLIST extension). It's safe to assume that once <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Connect(System.String,System.Int32,System.Net.Sockets.Socket,System.Net.EndPoint)"/> method finished, you can
            examine the value of <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UseXList"/> property to determine if the server supports well-known folder types.</para>
            <para>If you want to disable using XLIST, keep in mind that MailBee automatically sets this property to match the server capabilities when it encounters XLIST support in the server response (usually, during login),
            so you'll need to set it AFTER you logged in. For instance, just before <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadFolders(System.Boolean,System.String,System.String)"/> call.</para>
            <para>When <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UseXList"/> is <b>true</b>, and you called <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadFolders(System.Boolean,System.String,System.String)"/> method specifying <i>subscribedOnly</i>=<b>false</b>,
            you can then examine <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Folder.Flags"/> property of each <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Folder"/> object in the retured collection for extra flags,
            like <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.FolderFlags.Drafts"/> or <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.FolderFlags.Inbox"/>.</para>
            <para>A better alternative to XLIST is SPECIAL-USE extension. If it's supported by the server, extended flags will be returned by the regular LIST command.
            Gmail supports both XLIST and SPECIAL-USE (although SPECIAL-USE does not appear in its CAPABILITITES list).</para>
            <note>
            <para>XLIST extension provides XLIST version of LIST command but no XLSUB command (LSUB lists subscribed-only folders).
            Thus, it's not possible to get extended flags only for subscribed folders,
            XLIST extension has no effect when you call <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadFolders(System.Boolean)"/> method passing <i>subscribedOnly</i> as <b>true</b>.</para>
            <para>However, this can be different with SPECIAL-USE capable servers and Gmail. Gmail provides extended folder flags for all commands: LIST, LSUB, XLIST.
            Most SPECIAL-USE capable servers support extended flags for both LIST and LSUB (although SPECIAL-USE RFC document requires this only for LIST).</para>
            </note>
            <para>With Gmail, as it in fact supports SPECIAL-USE, you can even set <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.UseXList"/>
            to <b>false</b> and still get all the flags. Small differences between LIST and XLIST output still exist in Gmail
            at the moment of writing (e.g. XLIST provides localized INBOX name
            when Gmail interface is not English while LIST always returns "INBOX").</para>

            <para>This sample demonstrates reliable approach to downloading messages from an IMAP4 account.
            The code tolerates disconnections and other errors which may occur during downloading messages.
            If any problem occurs, the code reconnects to the server if needed and attempts to download the
            remaining messages (already downloaded messages are not downloaded again, however).
            Also, the code execution won't end up in an endless loop in the case of permanent errors
            (if no messages had been downloaded at all, the code won't try again).</para>

            is much more efficient than calling <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.QuickDownloadMessage(System.String,System.String,System.String,System.String,System.Int32,System.Int32)"/> method multiple times.</para>

            in MailBee documentation assume the license key is already set in the config file.</note>
            <para>This method is not async, it's recommended (and in case of UWP platform it's mandatory) to use sync methods like <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEntireMessagesAsync(System.String,System.Boolean)"/>.</para>

            <para>When MailBee encounters any error, it throws the <see cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeException"/>.
            However, MailBee can trap this exception if the error was not critical. For instance,
            if the IMAP4 server responds with a FETCH response containing envelope data which could not be completely parsed,
            the <see cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeException"/> will be thrown and then trapped by MailBee itself,
            but no exception will be thrown to the application code. Such errors are called <i>warnings</i>.</para>

            <remarks>Unlike <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.LowLevelDataSent"/> event, occurrence of this event
            indicates sending IMAP4-related data only. For instance, if the transmission channel
            is SSL-encrypted, <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.LowLevelDataSent"/> event indicates sending
            of any portion of encrypted data, while <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DataSent"/> will be raised later
            to indicate the entire request (which was previously sent as one or several encrypted
            data chunks) has been sent. If the transmission channel is not encrypted or otherwise
            scrambled, <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DataSent"/> and <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.LowLevelDataSent"/> are equivalent.</remarks>

            Occurs when MailBee needs a new socket object for establishing a connection with the IMAP4 server.
            <seealso cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Connected"/>
            </summary>
            <remarks>This event is raised just before MailBee will start making the connection (i.e. before <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.SocketConnected"/> event).
            This lets you specify your own socket object in case if you need some special socket settings. For instance, configure SSL settings for new sockets in UWP apps.
            If you need this, set <see cref="P:MailBee.SocketCreatingEventArgs.NewSocket"/> property to the socket object needed in your event handler.
            <note>It's possible that this event will fire multiple times in case if the host has multple endpoints assigned. For instance, if the first endpoint was IPv6,
            the connection could not be made but second endpoint (IPv4) would succeed. On each call of this event handler, your code must supply a new, fresh socket object (otherwise MailBee
            will create its own). By default, however, MailBee tries IPv4 addresses first (see <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.PreferIPv4Hosts"/>) so this situation is unlikely to happen.</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>This code snippet shows how to ignore some SSL certificate errors when making SSL/TLS connections in a UWP app (useful if you connect to local hosts with self-signed certificates, etc).

            Occurs when the IMAP4 server accepts the connection attempt and opens the transmission
            channel between the remote host (IMAP4 server) and the client (MailBee).
            <seealso cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Connected"/>
            </summary>
            <remarks>This event is raised immediately after <see cref="T:System.Net.Sockets.Socket"/>
            successfully connected to the IMAP4 server host. After the socket itself has been connected
            and this event raised, the client needs to receive some data from the server in order to
            complete the procedure of establishing connection with the IMAP4 server. If the connection
            must be SSL-encrypted, a few additional round-trips to the server required in order
            to completely establish the connection. Then, once the connection is fully initialized and
            ready for sending IMAP4 commands to the server, <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Connected"/> event is raised.
            </remarks>
            <example>This sample demonstrates the order in which events are raised during
            <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Connect(System.String,System.Int32,System.Net.Sockets.Socket,System.Net.EndPoint)"/> method call. The events used in this sample occur in the following order:

            </list>
            <para>
            Once <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Connect(System.String,System.Int32,System.Net.Sockets.Socket,System.Net.EndPoint)"/> method finishes, all event handlers are removed in the code, thus
            <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Disconnect"/> method does not generate any events (but it would do if we didn't
            remove <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.LowLevelDataReceived"/> and <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DataReceived"/> handlers).
            </para>
            <para><see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DataSent"/> and <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.LowLevelDataSent"/> events are not used in
            this sample because <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.Connect(System.String,System.Int32,System.Net.Sockets.Socket,System.Net.EndPoint)"/> method does not send any data to the server.
            However, it would be different if SSL-encrypted connection was used.</para>

            <remarks>
            <para>
            In the IMAP4 protocol, all message related information is returned as a series of FETCH responses (one response per each message).
            Each FETCH response may consist of various elements, and the most common of them is ENVELOPE. When processing the server response,
            MailBee parses every FETCH response into an <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> object.
            </para>
            <para>
            MailBee methods which download messages or envelopes raise <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.EnvelopeDownloaded"/> event is raised each time a FETCH response was parsed and corresponding <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/>
            object created. Currently, the list of methods which raise <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.EnvelopeDownloaded"/> and <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.EnvelopeDataChunkReceived"/> events is as follows:
            <list type="bullet">

            </list>
            </para>
            <para>
            Other methods never raise these events (even if deal with FETCH responses). For instance, <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetFolderSize"/> method
            gets FETCH responses containing the size of each message for all messages in the folder. Although this method does receive FETCH
            responses, it does not raise <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.EnvelopeDownloaded"/> and <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.EnvelopeDataChunkReceived"/> events.
            </para>
            <para>
            The developer can use <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapEnvelopeDownloadedEventArgs.DownloadedEnvelope"/> property to access the downloaded envelope.
            <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.MessagePreview"/> contains a reference to the <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/>
            object within the envelope.
            </para>
            <para><see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapEnvelopeDownloadedEventArgs.DownloadedEnvelope"/> property is writable. For instance, the developer can set it to a null reference
            (<b>Nothing</b> in Visual Basic) to prevent this envelope from being added to the resulting collection. This can be used to filter
            incoming messages or to process messages directly in the event handler and avoid unnecessary memory overhead
            when the message is no longer needed.</para>
            <note>
            Sometimes, the mail server may send unilateral FETCH responses in addition to the requested ones. For instance,
            if the IMAP4 session lasts for a long period of time, and another client accesses the same folder simultaneously (for instance,
            downloads a message so it gets "\Seen" flag set), the server will also send unilateral FETCH response containing the updated flags
            of the amended message. Starting from MailBee.NET Objects v3.0, MailBee detects such unilateral responses and <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.EnvelopeDownloaded"/>
            event is NOT raised for them (<see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.MessageStatus"/> event is raised instead). Also, MailBee takes unilateral responses into account
            for calculating the folder statistics (total number of messages, number of unseen messages, etc).
            </note>
            </remarks>
            <example>This console sample displays the total size (via <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.GetFolderSize"/>) and the
            individual sizes (via <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/>) of all messages in the folder.
            The logging into a file is enabled. The sample demonstrates <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.EnvelopeDownloaded"/> is raised

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>The IMAP4 protocol allows the client to query information about all MIME parts
            of a mail message without downloading the entire message. The server returns this information
            as a tree of body structures, where each body structure describes the corresponding MIME part and
            contains a list of nested body structures if the corresponding MIME part is multipart.</para>
            <para>The common use of body structures is to list attachments of a mail message (see the sample code in
            <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> topic). Another case is processing envelopes of international messages, because body structures
            contain charset settings of mail messages. When a body structure of a certain message is available,
            MailBee is able to decode the message envelope fields containing international characters more correctly.</para>
            <para>When an entire message is downloaded, there is no need to download its body structure since all the required information is
            already available in the message data.</para>
            <para>To access body structure information, the developer should request receiving body structures from the server
            when calling <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEnvelopes(System.String,System.Boolean,MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts,System.Int32,System.String[],System.String[])"/> method by setting <see cref="F:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeParts.BodyStructure"/>
            flag in <i>parts</i> parameter value. A reference to the <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapBodyStructure"/> object representing the root MIME part
            of the mail message can then be obtained via <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.BodyStructure"/> property value.</para>
            <para>By default, MailBee represents the body structure tree as a branching linked list. This reflects
            nested nature of MIME parts. However, it's often more convenient to get this tree as a simple collection.
            MailBee provides <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapBodyStructure.GetAllParts"/> method for this.</para>

            each object represents a single FETCH response (one response corresponds to a single message).</para>
            <para>With FETCH commands, it's possible to download any parts or attributes of mail messages. The most common
            attribute is ENVELOPE (that's why MailBee's object which encapsulates FETCH response is called
            <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/>). However, with FETCH response, it's also possible to download any other elements

            <remarks>
            <para>When this property value is a null reference, this usually means the mail server replied with

            of <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap"/> class which had been used to download message(s) will throw an exception after the method has
            finished receiving data from the IMAP4 server.</para>
            <para>The developer can also manually set this property value to a null reference to avoid
            inclusion of this envelope into the resulting <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.EnvelopeCollection"/>. For methods returning a single envelope
            (such as <see cref="M:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.DownloadEntireMessage(System.Int64,System.Boolean)"/>), the result will be a null reference.</para>
            <para>Setting this property to a null reference is also useful for downloading very large number of messages at once
            (when they won't fit in memory). In this case, the developer can save each message to database/disk in <see cref="E:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap.EnvelopeDownloaded"/>
            event handler and then set <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.ImapEnvelopeDownloadedEventArgs.DownloadedEnvelope"/> to a null reference to free the resources. This is efficient

            Sorts the items in the collection by their priority value.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>Lower values are preferred. For instance, if the collection had
            4 elements with the following priority values: 1, 0, 3, 0, then after calling
            this method, the elements would be reordered as: 0, 0, 1, 3.</para>
            <para>If this method detects the collection is already sorted, no elements will be
            reordered. In other words, this method performs stable sort (in contrast to
            unstable sort when equal elements may be reordered).</para>
            <para>This method can be used if the developer changes priority of elements already
            added to the collection and wants to get the collection re-ordered accordingly new
            values of priority.</para>

            </para>
            <para>For instance, when two files with equal filenames <i>cat.jpg</i> are attached to the message, their original filenames
            will be <i>cat.jpg</i> for both the files, but their <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.Attachment.Filename"/> values will be <i>cat.jpg</i> and <i>cat[1].jpg</i>.
            </para>
            Thus, <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.Attachment.Filename"/> is usually equal to <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.Attachment.FilenameOriginal"/> of the same attachment, but it may be different sometimes.

            <example>This example downloads the last e-mail in IMAP inbox, extracts all attachments and RTF body from the TNEF (if any),
            saves the attachments to disk and displays the contents of the RTF body in the console.

            <remarks>
            This method can be used to forward mail messages with another mail message. To forward a single message,
            it's easier to use <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.ForwardAsAttachment"/> method.
            <note>Be sure to use as <see cref="F:MailBee.Mime.MailTransferEncoding.None"/> as <paramref name="mailEnc"/> value. Some mail services
            cannot decode attached emails if they are Base64-encoded.</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>The following example demonstrates how a mail message can be attached to another mail message.
            <code lang="C#">

            The <paramref name="targetFilename"/> parameter allows the developer to override the filename under which the attachment will be added to the collection.
            This is useful if the attachment is being added from a temporary file such as <i>ETQB4914.TMP</i> under meaningful name
            such as <i>report.doc</i>.
            </remarks>
            <example>This sample opens a file stream, reads the file into the stream, adds the attachment from the stream, and saves the message to disk.
            <note>In real-world apps, it's easier to use <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.AttachmentCollection.Add(System.String)"/> overload to add an attachment from a file.</note>

            <remarks>
            <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMerge"/> class is very flexible and can be used for creating of e-mail messages based on a template and data from any source.
            <para>However, if such flexibility is not needed and the source of the data is a database, then it's easier to use

            </remarks>
            <example>
            This sample defines a template and generates 3 e-mail messages based on it. The template includes
            both static fields (for instance, From field remains the same for all e-mails in the series)
            and dynamic patterns which are replaced with actual values for every e-mail generated. Two
            attachments are added to each message: one static and one pattern-based.

            <remarks>
            <para>Every part of an e-mail message may have its own charset (although it's not recommended). E-mails composed with MailBee have the same
            charset value across the message (unless you manually specified different charsets of text parts using <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.TextBodyPart.Charset">TextBodyPart.Charset</see> property).
            If text parts of the message (originally composed with another program and being parsed with MailBee now)
            have different charsets, <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Charset"/> property will return charset of the last text part of this message.</para>
            <para>For existing e-mail messages being parsed (rather than for new messages being composed) <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Charset"/> property value is not important
            for the developer because MailBee automatically converts the message content accordingly the charset information in the message and the application
            receives the already decoded content. In this case, <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Charset"/> property value has the informative feature only.</para>
            <para>However, when composing a new message (with international characters), you should specify the charset using <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Charset"/> property in case if you don't want UTF-8 encoding.
            Or, in rare cases, you will use <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.TextBodyPart.Charset">TextBodyPart.Charset</see> property if you need different charset settings for different text parts.</para>
            <para>If <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Charset"/> is not specified, MailBee will use the following properties to determine encoding for string-to-byte and byte-to-string conversions:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description><see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.EncodingDefault">MailMessage.Parser.EncodingDefault</see> property when parsing e-mail messages

            <para>Setting <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Charset"/> property will overwrite <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.TextBodyPart.Charset">TextBodyPart.Charset</see> values for all text parts of the message.
            But if you specified <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.TextBodyPart.Charset">TextBodyPart.Charset</see> value for a certain text part AFTER <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Charset"/> had been set, that text part
            will retain the specified <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.TextBodyPart.Charset">TextBodyPart.Charset</see> in the resulting message (while <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Charset"/> will be used for other text parts of the message).</para>

            <example>This sample demonstrates loading 1000 bytes of the message data from a file using a buffer of a fixed length (100 bytes). It's assumed the file
            is at least 1000 bytes in size.
            <note>
            <para>In real world applications, it's easier to load a message from a file/stream/memory using <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.LoadMessage(System.String)"/> method and its overloads.</para>
            <para>Also, real world apps shouldn't rely on the fact that <see cref="M:System.IO.FileStream.Read(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32)">FileStream.Read</see> method of .NET framework always returns the requested number of bytes.
            They should rather check its return value and repeat reading attempt if the number of bytes read was less than requested. The code snippet in
            <see cref="M:System.IO.FileStream.Read(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32)">FileStream.Read</see> topic in MSDN shows how this can be done.</para>

            <para>Some mail client programs can split large messages into a number of smaller messages before sending
            and then send these smaller e-mails separately. This technique was used to overcome limitations of
            maximum size of a message which existed on some mail servers. Nowadays, this practice is not used but MailBee is still capable
            of parsing such messages. To assembly a message from its parts (they have <i>message/partial</i> in their <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.ContentType"/>),
            you should get the first part (having <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.PartIndex"/> set to 1), and append the remaining messages in the correct
            order (with <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.PartIndex"/> set to 2, 3, etc) using <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.AppendPartialMessage(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage)"/> until it returns <b>true</b>.
            <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.AppendPartialMessage(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage)"/> returns <b>true</b> when you append a message having <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.PartIndex"/> equal to <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.PartCount"/>.</para>
            <para>Use <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.PartCount"/> property to determine if the mail message is split
            (and so it's needed to get the remaining parts and join them with <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.AppendPartialMessage(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage)"/> method).</para>
            <para>
            Use <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.PartIndex"/> property to obtain the index of the message so that you would be able to pass
            the messages to be appended by <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.AppendPartialMessage(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage)"/> method in proper order (from 1 to <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.PartCount"/>).

            <remarks>
            <para>To clear the entire message (i.e. to reset all its properties to default values), the developer should use <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Reset"/> method.</para>
            <para>To clear raw body of the message, you can use <c>Msg.Clear(MessageElements.RawBody)</c> call. This is useful if you already received an e-mail and parsed it.
            If you have no plans to further access the raw data of the e-mail (e.g. write the e-mail into .EML file), you do not need the raw body data
            (which might be very large), and can free it. However, if you then call and method or property which operates on the raw body (such as <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Size"/> property),
            the message will be rebuilt and the raw body regenerated. Be sure to call all such properties and methods BEFORE clearing the raw body.</para>
            <para>Another purpose of <c>Msg.Clear(MessageElements.RawBody)</c> is after sending a very large e-mail. For instance, you're sending multiple very large e-mails
            and want to have as much free memory as possible before every e-mail gets built to avoid out-of-memory issues. You can use <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Reset"/> method and then call
            <see cref="M:System.GC.Collect"/> (<c>GC.Collect</c>) but this will also remove all the attachments and other parts of the message. In case if you want to send the same attachments
            in multiple e-mails, this would degrade performance. With <c>Msg.Clear(MessageElements.RawBody)</c> you can preserve the attachments already loaded
            and free only the generated raw message data.</para>

            This method can be used by the web application developer to display an HTML-formatted mail message with embedded pictures
            in the browser. In addition to the basic functionality provided by <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.GetHtmlAndSaveRelatedFiles"/> overload,
            this method is also capable of:
            <list type="number">
            <item><description>Using virtual paths instead of physical paths when referencing embedded objects in HTML body. This is important for
            web applications where files are saved to disk using physical paths but referenced in HTML body using virtual paths.</description></item>
            <item><description>Creating a unique message folder in <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.WorkingFolder">MailMessage.Parser.WorkingFolder</see> and storing all message files there
            instead of placing all the files into <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.WorkingFolder">MailMessage.Parser.WorkingFolder</see> itself. This is important when multiple clients
            can use the system simultaneously and thus multiple messages can be stored in <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.WorkingFolder">MailMessage.Parser.WorkingFolder</see> at the same time.
            The name of this folder is an SHA1 digest of <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.MessageID"/> of the message. Since Message-ID's are unique, any particular
            message folder name is unique as well. Having unique subfolder for each message guarantees there will be no any collisions in multi-user environment.
            <note>
            If <paramref name="folderMode"/> is <see cref="F:MailBee.Mime.MessageFolderBehavior.CreateOnly"/>,
            the unique folder will be created and filled with the message files, but not deleted after the
            <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> object destruction. This is useful in web applications where all objects get automatically deleted once a response to
            the client has been generated. In this case, the message files/folder must retain after <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> destruction, and should only be deleted
            when the user has finished viewing the message (the user requested another page or the current
            session timed out). To remember which temporary folder to delete later, the application should save
            the names of the created unique folder in Session, database, or any other store which retains its data between round-trips to the server.
            To get this name, the developer can call <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.GetMessageFolder">MailMessage.Parser.GetMessageFolder</see> method after the unique folder
            has been created during <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.GetHtmlAndSaveRelatedFiles(System.String,MailBee.Mime.VirtualMappingType,MailBee.Mime.MessageFolderBehavior)"/> method call.

            If <paramref name="mappingType"/> is <see cref="F:MailBee.Mime.VirtualMappingType.Dynamic"/>, the <i>virtualPath</i> parameter must point to a downloader page.
            Downloader page is a dynamic web page (such as an ASP.NET script) which should accept <i>message_id</i> and <i>file_id</i> parameters,
            grab <i>file_id</i> file in <i>message_id</i> folder and send its binary contents to the client. This allows the developer
            to save all inline attachments in the folder which is not directly visible from the web, and use the downloader script to push the file
            contents to the client. The downloader script can also check user credentials or SessionID to validate the user and do not return
            the attachment content if the user does not pass the authentication or session check.
            </para>
            <para><i>message_id</i> folder is the name of a unique message folder where all the files of the mail message are saved.
            If <i>folderMode</i> is <see cref="F:MailBee.Mime.MessageFolderBehavior.DoNotCreate"/>, the message files are saved directly in <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.WorkingFolder"/>, and
            <i>message_id</i> is an empty string.
            </para>
            <para><i>file_id</i> is a <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.Attachment.Filename"/> of the inline attachment being referenced.</para>

            <para>Seting <c>msg.Parser.WorkingFolder</c> property value to some absolute path is mandatory in case if the HMTL in the e-mail message contains BASE tag

            (assuming <c>msg</c> is <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> instance). Another option is using <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.GetHtmlAndSaveRelatedFiles"/> method and its overloads.</para>
            <para>If you're getting non-Latin characters not being displayed correctly in resulting HTML files, consider setting <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.WriteUtf8ByteOrderMark"/>

            <note>You may consider much simpler way of showing HTML e-mails with embedded images by direct base64 embedding of these images into the HTML.
            Use <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.GetHtmlWithBase64EncodedRelatedFiles"/> method for that. You can then save its result into an HTML file.</note>

            This can only occur with older .NET versions (before 4.0) because there was no FIPS-certified SHA256 implementation at that time.

            does not contain the entire path. To constuct the entire path, the relative path needs to be prepended with certain base path.
            If this base path is not the current folder in your case, you need to specify it in this property.</para>

            For instance, if you configured MailBee to generate plain-text version of the HTML body during building the message

            This sample creates a new message, tells MailBee parser to save the message as message.htm file (and related files if any)
            during parsing the message, and parses the message to make message.htm be saved.
            <note>The message will be parsed automatically if it was not yet parsed and the application requested any item of the message
            which can be obtained from parsed message only. For instance, reading <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Subject"/> property or accessing
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Attachments"/> collection will trigger the parser if the message was not parsed yet.
            However, in this sample we do not need any values of <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> properties and thus we request parsing explicitly
            using <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.Apply"/> method.</note>

            If you set <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.ParseHeaderOnly"/> BEFORE loading the message, the loading routine will not even load everything but the header from the file (or stream).

            (such as ASP.NET Session) and then use this path to delete the folder later.</para>
            <para>If <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.GetHtmlAndSaveRelatedFiles(System.String,MailBee.Mime.VirtualMappingType,MailBee.Mime.MessageFolderBehavior)"/> was called with <i>folderMode</i>

            <para>Automatic saving of the message files during parsing the message can be enabled with <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.AutoSaveHtmlMode"/> if required. By default,
            MailBee does not write anything to disk during parsing.</para>
            <para>When <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.WorkingFolder"/> is a null reference,
            it's internally assumed that <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.WorkingFolder"/> specifies the system temporary folder of the current user.
            Thus, <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.GetMessageFolder"/> value will be different from <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.WorkingFolder"/> (which is a null reference)
            but the behaviour will be the same as described above (for instance, in regard to whether to create unique message sub-folders in the specified folder, etc).</para>
            <para>The same is true if <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.WorkingFolder"/> is an empty string (the default value). Because, <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.GetMessageFolder"/> always returns the full path, in this case
            it will return the full path to the current folder of the application.</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>This sample demonstrates how to get the path of the folder with the message files if MailBee is configured to create
            unique folder specially for this message within the specified folder.

            <remarks>
            <para>Each e-mail message consists of one or more MIME parts.
            Each MIME part consists of a header section and (optionally) a body section. The body section may
            contain the actual content (text, binary data, etc) or other MIME parts nested into this part.
            Attachments, text body parts and the message itself are examples of MIME parts.</para>
            <para>During parsing the message, MailBee creates a tree of linked <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MimePart"/> and <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MimePartCollection"/> objects.</para>
            <para>To access the MIME part which corresponds to the message itself (the root part), use
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.MimePartTree"/> property. To access the MIME part which corresponds
            to a certain attachment, use <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.Attachment.AsMimePart"/> property of that <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.Attachment"/>
            object. To access the MIME part which corresponds to a certain text body part,
            use <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.TextBodyPart.AsMimePart"/> property of that <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.TextBodyPart"/>
            object.</para>
            <para>Because most properties of <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MimePart"/> and <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.Attachment"/> object have the same meaning
            (and every attachment is internally a MIME part - you can get it with <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.Attachment.AsMimePart">Attachment.AsMimePart</see> property),
            the documentation on these properties usually refers to their versions in <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.Attachment"/> class.
            Some <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MimePart"/> properties, however, not applicable or important for <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.Attachment"/> object and thus can only be found in <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MimePart"/> class.</para>
            <para>It's usually not need to create <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MimePart"/> objects manually. To compose a message consisting of multiple parts,
            add attachments or text body parts to it. MailBee will produce MIME parts for them during building the message.</para>
            <para>However, it's possible to create an instance of <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MimePart"/> class using <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MimePart.Parse(System.Byte[])"/> method.</para>

            <remarks>
            <para>This class is for advanced use. Use it only if have web application which is non-Unicode (not UTF-8) and you need
            to avoid conversion of the mail message data into the response charset. This may happen when ASP.NET
            produces the page output (which consits of 8-bit bytes, not 16-bit Unicode chars) and thus converts the data
            from strings into bytes. The default conversion into the response charset may cause loss of characters
            which are not defined in this charset.</para>
            <para>To avoid this, MailBee can simulate that the message data belong to the system charset
            while this is actually not so. The details of "string to byte and back to string" approach are:
            <list type="number">
            <item><description>Convert a string into bytes accordingly the appropriate character encoding (this encoding can be
            taken from the charset information of the message or hardcoded using <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.StringConversionConfig.DestinationEncoding"/> property).</description></item>
            <item><description>Convert the bytes into a string accordingly <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.StringConversionConfig.CustomByteEncoding"/> (prior to that,
            the application should set <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.StringConversionConfig.CustomByteEncoding"/> to the value of <i>responseEncoding</i> setting
            of web.config file) and return the resulting string to the application.</description></item>
            <item><description>Then, ASP.NET takes the string generated at the previous step and puts it into the response buffer (which is a byte stream) by
            converting it from the string into bytes (i.e. opposite action). Since ASP.NET uses the same <i>responseEncoding</i> for that, the resulting byte array will be exactly the same as
            the one generated at the first step (the second and the third steps compensated each other). This way, the client will receive the same bytes which have been generated by MailBee
            (these bytes hold the message data encoded in the original message charset or in <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.StringConversionConfig.DestinationEncoding"/> charset). Thus, no characters
            will be lost when ASP.NET produces the page response and thus converts the string data into <i>responseEncoding</i> even if
            the string data contain characters which are not defined in <i>responseEncoding</i> charset.</description></item>
            </list>
            Because the client will receive the message data in the charset specified in the message (or in
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.StringConversionConfig.DestinationEncoding"/> charset), you should also properly set META tag of the HTML data received by the client.
            You can use <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageParserConfig.CharsetMetaTagMode">MailMessage.Parser.CharsetMetaTagMode</see> property for this.
            However, if you have not hard-coded the desired charset with <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.StringConversionConfig.DestinationEncoding"/> property
            and send the message data in its original charset, you should also take care of any other non-ASCII data
            you may be sending in the server response. For instance, if the HTML data you're sending to the client
            browser also contain any labels with international characters (such as localized UI elements),
            they may render incorrectly if they belong to another charset (not the one used the message was composed in).
            The typical workaround is to HTML encode any international characters so they would become charset independent.
            </para>
            <para>In short, the main purpose of this class is to transfer the given byte data (as it appears in the message) to the client provided that this
            data will pass through ASP.NET response generator which accepts only strings. This means the byte data should be wrapped
            into strings using the same encoding used by ASP.NET to convert them from strings back to bytes. You should set this encoding via
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.StringConversionConfig.CustomByteEncoding"/> property.</para>
            <para>With this class it's also possible to modify the encoding of the byte data itself (<see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.StringConversionConfig.DestinationEncoding"/> property).
            It affects the charset of the data the client will receive. Or, you can tell MailBee to retain the original charset encoding of the data as
            it appears in the message.</para>
            <para>To set a particular mode of the charset conversion, use <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.StringConversionConfig.ConversionMode"/> property.</para>

            Each mail server usually alters the message by adding a new Received header which contains the information about this server

            <remarks>
            <para>When a mail message gets sent, it passes through one or more mail servers (gateways) during the delivery.
            Each mail server usually alters the message by adding a new Received header which contains the information about this server
            and time stamp of the moment when the message passed through this server. <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.TimeStamp"/>
            class represents the information extracted from a single Received header during parsing the message.</para>
            <para>All <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.TimeStamp"/> objects are stored in <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.TimeStampCollection"/> which represents
            all Received headers of the message. You can access this collection using <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.TimeStamps"/> property.</para>
            <para>The first <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.TimeStamp"/> object in the collection usually represents the moment when the message was received
            by the destination mail server. MailBee uses this <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.TimeStamp"/> object to obtain <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.DateReceived"/> value.</para>
            <note>Some mail servers do not add Received headers. Thus, no time stamps will be available to the application. In this case, the only way to
            obtain the date when the message was received is to get <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope"/> of the message using IMAP and get the date from
            <see cref="P:MailBee.ImapMail.Envelope.DateReceived"/> property. Also, even if Received header itself is available, some of its fields may be missing.</note>
            <para>Because <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.TimeStampCollection"/> object contains all the time stamps associated with the message,
            you can easily find out the full route of the message from its sender to its recipient, determine
            if there had been any delays during the delivery, etc.</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>This sample loads the message from .EML file and, for each of the time stamps, displays the information (if available)

            You need to provide fresh socket object each time because sockets cannot be reused no matter if the connection attempt failed or not.

            <para>.MSG files may have up to 3 alternative versions of the text body: plain-text, HTML, RTF (Rich-Text-format).
            By default, RTF body is displayed if present. However, .EML messages do not have RTF body. If, for some reason, you need
            to generate .MSG file with RTF body (HTML in .MSG is not enough for your purpose), the conversion between HTML and RTF must be performed. Such conversion is very complex because
            HTML and RTF formats are very different and both have very sophisticated formatting mechanisms, so it's not practically possible to match
            all the features of one format with another. MailBee provides only basic level of such conversions. If you, however, have a tool
            which is capable of making a better HTML-to-RTF conversion, you can use it with MailBee.</para>

            However, because MailBee's internal converter cannot transform all the HTML formatting into RTF formatting
            (this would be an extremely complex task because both formats have lots of formatting mechanisms and they are
            very different), the formatting of the resulting RTF won't be perfect. Also, if you strictly need
            RTF and MailBee's converter is not suitable for you, you can plug your own converter in (for instance, if you have
            a dedicated component for HTML-to-RTF conversion). See <see cref="T:MailBee.Outlook.HtmlToRtfConversionMethod"/> topic for details.</remarks>

            for the completion of the asynchronous method. See <see cref="M:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.BeginConnect(System.String,System.Int32,System.Boolean,System.AsyncCallback,System.Object)"/> method

            Another alternative (in WinForms application) to using <see cref="M:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.Wait"/> method

            method for the code example.
            <note>In many cases, it's easier not to use events at all but derive a new class from
            <see cref="T:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3"/> class and override corresponding <i>OnEventName</i> method in order
            to get the developer-supplied code executed. See <see cref="M:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.OnConnected(MailBee.ConnectedEventArgs)"/> method

            the list of supported authentication methods (AUTH command responsible

            <note>If CAPA command has already been issued (for instance, this
            method has already been called or MailBee downloaded this list for its own purpose

            <exception cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeException">An error occurred and <see cref="P:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.ThrowExceptions"/> is <b>true</b>.</exception>
            <remarks>
            <para>When <paramref name="bodyLineCount"/> is 0, only the message header is downloaded. When
            <paramref name="bodyLineCount"/> is -1, this method is equivalent to <see cref="M:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.DownloadEntireMessage(System.Int32)"/>
            method.</para>
            <para>Setting <paramref name="bodyLineCount"/> to a positive value allows the developer
            to implement message body preview feature. In this case, it's recommended
            to set <paramref name="bodyLineCount"/> &gt;= 20 since the first 5-15 lines of the message source body
            are often filled with the special information and do not contain the actual body text.</para>
            <para>If <paramref name="bodyLineCount"/> is set to a certain value (such as 100),
            small messages having less than 100 lines in the message source body will be downloaded
            completely. Larger messages will be parsed partially. For instance, if 100 body lines of the
            message have been received, and the message contains an attachment which starts at 80-th line
            and ends at 150-th line of the message source body (so it has not fitted in the 100 lines received),
            MailBee will still add this attachment into <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Attachments"/>
            collection, but the attachment binary data will obviously be incomplete.</para>
            <note>If the POP3 server supports pipelining, this method will download all the messages in a single
            network operation, which greatly increases performance and reduces network traffic.</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>This sample downloads the header and 300 lines (approx. 20-30 KBytes) of the message source body for every message in an inbox
            on a POP3 server, and displays whether the messages probably contain attachments or not.
            <note>If no attachment is found in a partial message, there is still no guarantee
            the message would not contain attachments if was downloaded completely; the message may just have
            a large body text section which spans more than 300 lines in the entire message.
            If more body lines (such as 1000) are downloaded with the header, 
            attachment detection quality will be higher, but at the cost of increased network traffic with the server.
            Another approach is to use <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.HasAttachments"/> property, however, it's still
            not 100% accurate, because it may indicate the message does have attachments if it actually doesn't but the message
            header reports the message has at least one attachment.</note>

            <example>Sending a mail message to the POP3 server in WinForms application
            (the POP3 server must support XTND XMIT extension). Sending itself is performed in a few stages:
            <list type="number">
            <item><description>Send XTND XMIT command</description></item>
            <item><description>If the server returned positive response indicating XTND XMIT extension
            is supported, send message source data (encoded as multi-line POP3 request)</description></item>
            <item><description>If the server returned positive response, the message was accepted for delivery</description></item>
            </list>
            Callback functions are actively used, and the application message loop never gets blocked
            (no waiting for an asynchronous method completion is used). Thus, we do need to care about
            dead-locks which would occur if an event was raised while the message loop was blocked
            by somewhat like <see cref="M:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne"/> method call.
            This sample's code does not handle any events, but it's safe to use them if needed.

            <remarks>
            <note>This is an advanced property which serves special purposes. It's activated via setting
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.EnableLastDownloaded"/> prior to calling a method which requests mail messages from the server.</note>
            <para>This property can be used to get downloaded mail messages in the case if the
            corresponding method failed. <see cref="T:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3"/> methods throw an exception or return
            a null reference on failure. Sometimes, however, the developer still wishes to get messages which
            had already been received to the moment of failure (for instance, if 100 messages had been received
            and error occurred for message #101). In this case, the developer can use this property to get messages
            which had already been received and parsed to the moment of the failure.</para>
            <para>When this collection is not needed any longer, the developer should set <see cref="P:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.EnableLastDownloaded"/>
            to <b>false</b> to free the resources. Also, <see cref="P:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.LastDownloadedMessages"/> will be reset to a null reference
            with a new call of any method requesting mail messages from the server.</para>

            <para>This sample demonstrates reliable approach to downloading messages from a POP3 account.
            The code tolerates disconnections and other errors which may occur during downloading messages.
            If any problem occurs, the code reconnects to the server if needed and attempts to download the
            remaining messages (already downloaded messages are not downloaded again, however).
            Also, the code execution won't end up in an endless loop in the case of permanent errors
            (if no messages had been downloaded at all, the code won't try again).</para>
            <para>To simulate connection drops during the POP3 session, the code suddenly closes the connection
            during getting message data from the server.</para>

            CAPA), the <see cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeException"/> will be thrown and then trapped by MailBee itself,

            <para>MailBee raises this event BEFORE adding the entry into the the log. Since many
            properties of <see cref="P:MailBee.LogNewEntryEventArgs.NewEntry"/> object are editable, the
            developer can change the data MailBee will put into the log or even cancel logging the current

            which meet certain criteria.</para>
            <note>Entries added by the developer (through <see cref="M:MailBee.Logger.WriteLine(System.String)"/>

            <remarks>
            <para>If the transmission channel is encrypted, this event will be raised
            each time an encrypted chunk of data is successfully sent. Thus, this event
            can be used to record the data which is actually sent to the network.</para>
            <para>The typical use of this property is to calculate the network traffic
            produced during the POP3 session. SSL encryption increases the length of the
            transmitted data blocks, thus it's more accurate to calculate traffic by counting
            the length of data actually transmitted over the network.</para>

            <remarks>This event is raised just before MailBee will start making the connection (i.e. before <see cref="E:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.SocketConnected"/> event).
            This lets you specify your own socket object in case if you need some special socket settings.
            If you need this, set <see cref="P:MailBee.SocketCreatingEventArgs.NewSocket"/> property to the socket object needed in your event handler.
            <note>It's possible that this event will fire multiple times in case if the host has multple endpoints assigned. For instance, if the first endpoint was IPv6,
            the connection could not be made but second endpoint (IPv4) would succeed. On each call of this event handler, your code must supply a new, fresh socket object (otherwise MailBee
            will create its own). By default, however, MailBee tries IPv4 addresses first (see <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.PreferIPv4Hosts"/>) so this situation is unlikely to happen.</note>

            <remarks>This event is raised immediately after <see cref="T:System.Net.Sockets.Socket"/>

            and this event raised, the client needs to receive some data from the server in order to
            complete the procedure of establishing connection with the POP3 server. If the connection
            must be SSL-encrypted, a few additional round-trips to the server required in order
            to completely establish the connection. Then, once the connection is fully initialized and
            ready for sending POP3 commands to the server, <see cref="E:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.Connected"/> event is raised.

            Once <see cref="M:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.Connect(System.String,System.Int32,System.Boolean)"/> method finishes, all event handlers are removed in the code, thus

            MailBee will detect <i>UIDL</i> has not been issued yet, and then send this command
            to the server. If the developer does not want to rely on automatic download of

            <para>However, if you deal with large multi-megabyte e-mails, it's strongly recommended to set <see cref="F:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3InboxPreloadOptions.List"/> flag
            in <see cref="P:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.InboxPreloadOptions"/> value prior
            to logging into a mailbox. This way MailBee will know the size of each e-mail before downloading and allocate

            <para>Setting this property to a null reference is also useful for downloading very large number of messages at once
            (when they won't fit in memory). In this case, the developer can save each message to database/disk in <see cref="E:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.MessageDownloaded"/>
            event handler and then set <see cref="P:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3MessageDownloadedEventArgs.DownloadedMessage"/> to a null reference to free the resources. This is efficient

            <remarks>This property can be used to evaluate download progress of the current message

            response containing the message data is always greater (by 1-2%) due to presence
            some additional information in the response.
            <note>If partial messages are downloaded (such as message headers), this property
            returns -1, since the POP3 protocol has no feature to learn the length of a message header
            without downloading it. Only lengths of entire messages can be obtained. However,
            usually it's not a problem - since a message header is usually short, it is, anyway, received

            an optional POP3 command.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>This exception is never thrown in the application code. Instead, MailBee catches
            it, and raises <see cref="E:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.ErrorOccurred"/> event passing the exception instance as
            the <i>Reason</i> parameter value.</para>
            <para>This exception indicates the POP3 server does not support an optional POP3 command which
            was sent to the server by MailBee. For instance, MailBee may try to send <i>CAPA</i> command
            in order to learn the server capabilities. The POP3 server, however, may not support it.
            In this case, MailBee continues normal execution and tries another methods to perform
            the current task or disables POP3 extensions which could be supported if the failed
            command succeeded. However, <see cref="E:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.ErrorOccurred"/> event is still raised to let
            the application code know that some features will be disabled.</para>

            <note>This exception does not indicate that authentication using the given method failed.
            Instead, it indicates the method itself is not supported by the server. When the method
            is supported but the authentication using this method fails (invalid account name/password),
            MailBee does not try another methods (there would be no sense if it did),
            and throws <see cref="T:MailBee.Pop3Mail.MailBeePop3LoginBadCredentialsException"/>.</note>

            Digital certificate is a statement which uses a digital signature to bind together a public key of an entity
            with information about this entity. After the trusted organization (also called a certification authority, CA)
            has verified the entity, it issues the requested certificate to the entity.

            <para>
            Certificates can contain different types of data, such as
            the serial number of the certificate, the algorithm used to sign the certificate, the name
            of the CA that issued the certificate, the name and public key of the entity requesting the certificate,
            and the CA's signature.

            <para>Certificate store is a persistent or memory storage of certificates.
            There are a number of types of certificate stores supported by Windows (and therefore by MailBee), listed
            in <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.CertStoreType"/> enumeration.</para>
            <para>Stores of <see cref="F:MailBee.Security.CertStoreType.System"/> type play key role in many security procedures.
            You can view the contents of the system stores in "Internet Options/Content/Certificates" dialog of Internet Explorer.
            <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.CertificateStore"/> class defines several constants which refer to the standard system stores
            (such as <see cref="F:MailBee.Security.CertificateStore.Personal"/>). Also, you can create your own system stores with <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.CertificateStore.RegisterSystemStore(System.String,MailBee.Security.RegistryStoreLocation)"/> method.
            </para>
            <note>In UWP, this class is available starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators update.</note>
            <note>In .NET Standard 2.0 edition, this class is a thin wrapper around <see cref="T:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store"/>. Moreover, <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.Smime"/> class now provides new
            crypto methods with "2" suffix in their names which make using <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.CertificateStore"/> class unnecessary.</note>
            <note>ASP.NET application developers should be aware that the system certificate stores
            of ASP.NET user may contain fewer number of certificates in comparison to those of regular users. See
            S/MIME Demo for ASP.NET sample project shipped with the product for more information on how
            to deal with this.</note>

            Creates a new certificate store in memory.
            </summary>
            <remarks>This overload is typically used for creating a store which can then be filled
            with one or more certificates and either saved to a file or passed to a method which accepts
            <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.CertificateStore"/> as a parameter. The latter case is useful when you need
            to notify a method about a store with some certificates in it but you do not already
            have such a store. For instance, you can call <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.Certificate.Validate(MailBee.Security.CertificateStore)"/>
            method with <i>extraStore</i> parameter pointing to a store containing certificates of all certification authorities
            needed for validation. However, it's possible that some of these certificates reside in another store. Since
            you cannot pass two stores to <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.Certificate.Validate(MailBee.Security.CertificateStore)"/> method, you should either
            create a persistent store containing all the certificates from the both stores, or combine them at runtime by creating a new memory
            store and then adding certificates from both stores to the memory store. The latter approach does not require
            permissions to create files or new registry entries (which would be needed for modifying persistent certificate stores
            which reside in files or Windows registry).

            <remarks>
            <para>MailBee can create and verify signatures of two types: classic DomainKeys and newer DKIM (or both of them).
            By default, both DomainKeys and DKIM are used. However, some overloads of <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Sign(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,System.String[],System.Byte[],System.String,MailBee.Security.DomainKeysTypes)"/>
            and <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Verify(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp,MailBee.Security.DomainKeysTypes)"/> methods allow you to specify the exact DomainKeys type to be used.</para>
            <para>DK and DKIM use SHA algorithms for calculating hashes (for both signing and signature verification).
            DK always uses SHA1 algorithm while DKIM can use SHA1 but more secure SHA256 is preferred. MailBee by default creates DKIM
            signatures using SHA256. As for verification of DKIM signatures of existing messages, both SHA1 and SHA256 are supported.</para>
            <note>Checking or creating DKIM signatures may require the support of SHA256 algorithm
            from the system. If the current system is FIPS-compliant, you should enable
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> to make MailBee always use FIPS-compliant implementations of SHA1 and SHA256 (they are a bit slower than
            their managed code counterparts). However, FIPS-compliant SHA256 is still NOT available in .NET Framework 2.0/3.5.
            If <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> is enabled, MailBee for .NET 2.0/3.5 will use SHA1 for signing and can only verify SHA1 DKIM signatures.</note>
            <para>.NET 4.0+ and MailBee.NET.dll builds for .NET 4.0+ are OK for FIPS and can always use SHA256 for both signing and encryption
            (but for performance reasons it's still recommended to enable <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/>).</para>

            any of them are incorrect, the overall result will be "incorrect".
            However, when there are both DK/DKIM signatures and DKIM signature cannot be checked because it's
            SHA256 while the current system has no support for it (e.g. <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> is enabled and .NET Framework is older than 4.0),
            MailBee will ignore DKIM signature and return the result based on DK signature only.

            <note>In case of a FIPS-compliant system, enable <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> to make MailBee always use FIPS-compliant methods.
            If you don't do that, MailBee will fall back to a FIPS-compliant method only after the default method fails, and this degrades performance a bit.
            However, in .NET 2.0/3.5 the SHA256 method (which is used in DKIM) is available only as FIPS-noncompliant implementation. On a FIPS system,
            it's recommended to always use MailBee.NET.dll for .NET 4.0+ along with the corresponding .NET Framework.</note>

            This class serves two purposes:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>Signing e-mails to be sent out with DomainKeys (and/or DKIM) signature. The domain you're sending
            from (i.e. <i>company.com</i> if the From: address is <i>j.doe@company.com</i>) should have valid
            DomainKeys DNS TXT records containing the public key of your domain (this record should be placed
            not directly for sending domain but rather for its sub-domain called <i>selector</i>). The e-mails are signed with the private key
            for this domain. You can use <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Sign(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,System.String[],System.String,System.Boolean,System.String)"/> method and its overloads to sign messages with your private key.
            This method also accepts <i>selector</i> parameter so that you can use any name for selector sub-domain. For instance,
            Gmail currently uses "gamma" as <i>selector</i> value so that the entire DomainKeys domain name is "gamma._domainkey.gmail.com"
            where "._domainkey." suffix is predefined by DomainKeys standard.
            It's important to understand there can be no actual host under that name, it's just a DNS record.</description></item>
            <item><description>Verifying DomainKeys (and/or DKIM) signatures of e-mails you receive. This involves using
            <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> component for retrieving DomainKeys DNS record of the domain
            which sent the e-mail message in question, extracting the public key from that DNS record, and
            testing whether the signature matches that public key. No special DNS records are required on the receiving
            domain. Thus, you can always verify DomainKeys signatures regardless whether your domain has
            DomainKeys DNS record or not.</description></item>
            </list>
            <note>In many cases, you can use <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.DomainKeysSign(System.Boolean,System.String[],System.String,System.Boolean,System.String,MailBee.Security.DomainKeysTypes)"/> and <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.DomainKeysVerify"/> methods
            of <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> class to deal with DomainKeys and DKIM signatures. They are easier to use than <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys"/> class
            and do not require you to supply <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> object.</note>
            <para>If your domain does not have the necessary DNS TXT record holding DomainKeys data, you need to create one
            or contact your server administrator on this matter. You can create a public/private key pair
            with a tool such as OpenSSL. With OpenSSL, <b>be sure to set the private key length to 1024 bits or more</b>
            (DKIM itself does work with weaker keys but some providers like Gmail will not accept them).
            See RFC 4870 for more information on creating these keys.</para>
            <note>This class supports classic DomainKeys (DK) and newer DKIM technology. DK is always supported while
            DKIM support may require the system to support SHA256 algorithm. In case of a FIPS-compliant system, you should enable
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.FipsMode"/> and make sure you're using MailBee.NET.dll for .NET 4.0+.
            Read more on on SHA256 availability in <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.DomainKeysVerifyResult"/> topic.</note>
            <para>Although DK and DKIM are different technologies, DKIM uses the same DNS records, public/private keys
            and selectors as DK. Thus, checking both DK and DKIM signatures won't force <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Verify(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp)"/>
            method to send two DNS queries (for DK and DKIM). Only a single query regarding DomainKeys record will be made.</para>

            <remarks>
            <para>This methods and its overloads are for advanced DomainKeys/DKIM signing. In most cases, you can choose
            <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.DomainKeysSign(System.Boolean,System.String[],System.String,System.Boolean,System.String,MailBee.Security.DomainKeysTypes)"/> method which is easier to use (although not so flexible).
            Moreover, in ideal case it should be your your mail server's job to sign outgoing e-mails with DomainKeys/DKIM signatures. Use
            MailBee only if you cannot enable this feature on your mail server.</para>
            <para>To sign a message with DomainKeys/DKIM signatures, you must have a private key. For instance, you can create it with OpenSSL utility
            (see <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys"/> topic for more information). The key data is actually the bytes retrieved from base64 decoding of the key file.
            Thus, if you have a key file, you can directly use <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Sign(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,System.String[],System.String,System.Boolean,System.String)"/> overload.</para>
            <note>When composing and sending a new message, no headers get changed after the message had been signed and the signature remains valid.
            See <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Sign(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,System.String[],System.String,System.Boolean,System.String)"/> topic for a simple code sample.
            If you, however, sign an existing message (for instance, forwarding a message previously received from a POP3 server),
            then read the below on how to correctly create the signature.</note>
            <para>DK/DKIM standard requires the message to be signed must have <i>Sender</i> or <i>From</i> or <i>X-Sender</i> header and the e-mail address in that header must contain non-empty domain part.
            You can include all the headers into the signature (passing a null reference as <paramref name="headersToSign"/> value)
            so that any change in the headers the message originally had would make the signature invalid. In this case, you must set
            all the headers prior to signing the message and make sure MailBee won't change these headers during sending.</para>
            <para>Alternatively, you may include only certain headers into the signature (at least <i>Sender</i> or <i>From</i>)
            so that other headers can be changed. This is useful if you want to make sure the signature won't appear invalid
            when some headers get changed after the message has been signed. Typical case is when the mail server
            alters the headers of the signed message (changes <i>Date</i>, <i>Message-ID</i> or other headers).</para>
            <para>In other words, make sure that all headers listed in the signature have not changed their value after signing.
            To do this, either do not list these headers in the signature omitting them in <paramref name="headersToSign"/> array
            or add these headers to the message AFTER it has been signed. Adding new headers does not invalidate the signature, while changing
            the existing headers does.</para>
            <para>
            In the sample code to this topic, we take care of Date and Message-ID because we sign an existing message, not
            a new one. Thus, Date and Message-ID may already be present in the message being signed.
            Then, when MailBee sends the message, it by default sets Date and Message-ID to new values
            and this action makes the signature invalid. Four ways to prevent this:
            <list type="number">
            <item><description>Set Date and Message-ID manually BEFORE signing and suppress automatic
            setting of these values by MailBee during sending. The sample code to this topic uses this method.</description></item>
            <item><description>Simply clear Date and Message-ID prior to signing. This way, Date and Message-ID
            headers won't be included into the signature at all and thus automatic setting
            of these headers by MailBee during sending won't invalidate the signature. The recommended and the easiest method.</description></item>
            <item><description>Sign only certain headers of the message (using <paramref name="headersToSign"/> parameter).
            In this case, if Message-ID and Date headers are not included into the signature
            and you are free to modify them as you wish. Use this method if your mail server may change some headers
            and for some reason the message being signed already has these headers (i.e. you can't add them AFTER signing). </description></item>
            <item><description>Just suppress automatic setting of Message-ID and Date headers by MailBee
            during sending. In this case, the message being sent will retain the original
            Message-ID and Date values. This approach is not recommended because any e-mail ever sent
            should have unique Message-ID and having two messages with same Message-ID may
            cause some mail systems to think that such messages are duplicates.</description></item>
            </list>
            </para>
            <para>If you want to sign empty headers as well (to avoid tampering them), set <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageBuilderConfig.KeepEmptyHeaders"/> property of <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Builder"/> object to <b>true</b>.</para>
            <para>To make MailBee automatically DK/DKIM sign all outgoing e-mail messages created from certain <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> instance, call
            <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MessageBuilderConfig.SetDomainKeysSignOnSend(System.Boolean,System.Boolean,System.String[],System.String,System.Boolean,System.String,MailBee.Security.DomainKeysTypes)"/> method of <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Builder"/> object.</para>

            </remarks>
            <example>
            This console sample loads a message from file, signs it with DomainKeys signature
            (DomainKeys private key is taken from a file), and sends it out. <i>Date</i> and <i>Message-ID</i>
            headers are assigned BEFORE signing because they may already exist in the loaded message and thus would be
            included in the signature. Later, when the message gets sent, they would be set automatically and thus the signature would become invalid.
            We overcome this by manual settings of these headers before signing and disabling their automatic setting at the moment of sending.
            <note>Alternatively, we could simply clear <i>Date</i> and <i>Message-ID</i> prior to signing to prevent inclusion of these headers into the signature.</note>

            <remarks>
            <para>In order to verify DomainKeys/DKIM signature of e-mails, this method has to make DNS queries
            to the DomainKeys server of the sender. MailBee uses <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> class for this.
            Thus, you must have the appropriate license for <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> component. Or, you can use <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.DomainKeysVerify"/>
            which is simpler to use and does not require <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> license (but it's more limited in features).</para>
            <para>There is a chance your mail server may already check DomainKeys/DKIM signatures of incoming e-mails. If it's so, you
            should simply check extra headers which contain DomainKeys/DKIM checking results and get added by your mail server to the message.
            For instance, Gmail adds "Authentication-Results" header for that purpose.</para>
            <para>If your message has multiple DKIM signatures and you need to check them all, use <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Verify(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp,MailBee.Mime.Header)"/> overload.</para>
            <note>This method may take significant time to execute because it needs to make a network operation - DNS query.
            Also, if there is a problem with the DNS server, it may fail (return <see cref="F:MailBee.Security.DomainKeysVerifyResult.DnsQueryFailed"/>)
            even if the DomainKeys signature itself is correct. Also, if the message has both classic DomainKeys (DK) and newer DKIM signatures,
            the method will verify both of them to check if they match (this may double the execution time in case if DNS information for
            DK and DKIM records of the sending domain is different). If you wish to check only one type of DomainKeys
            signature, use <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Verify(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp,MailBee.Security.DomainKeysTypes)"/> overload.</note>
            <para>This method is thread-safe: you can call <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Verify(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp)"/> method for the same instance of <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys"/> class
            to speed up validating signatures of multiple e-mails. However, you should pass separate instance of
            <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> class as <paramref name="dnsRequestor"/> value for each <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.Verify(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp)"/> method call.</para>
            <note>If the current system is FIPS-compliant and runs .NET 2.0/3.5 and the message contains only DKIM signature created using SHA256 algorithm,
            the method will return <see cref="F:MailBee.Security.DomainKeysVerifyResult.Sha256NotSupported"/>
            or throw an exception if <see cref="P:MailBee.Security.DomainKeys.ThrowExceptions"/> is enabled.
            This can only occur with older .NET versions (before 4.0) because there was no FIPS-certified SHA256 implementation at that time.
            On a FIPS system, use MailBee.NET.dll for .NET 4.0+ to avoid these issues.
            All classic DK signatures and those DKIM signatures which use SHA1 algorithm are fully supported on all Windows platforms, including FIPS-compliant ones.

            <remarks>
            Some features of MailBee.Security namespace become available for use only if MailBee.NET Security is specifically licensed
            (the license key is set in <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.LicenseKey">MailBee.Global.LicenseKey</see> property includes Security license).
            With Security fully unlocked, the developer can:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>Assign client certificate when connecting to SSL-enabled mail server</description></item>
            <item><description>Examine the certificate of the SSL-enabled mail server</description></item>
            <item><description>Use S/MIME facilities, access certificates and certificate stores</description></item>
            <item><description>Impersonate another user account</description></item>
            </list>
            The only MailBee.Security feature which works even if Security license is not unlocked is the ability to
            connect to SSL-enabled mail servers. The application, however, will be unable to set or examine certificates
            involved in SSL handshake procedure.

            <para>If the message has so-called "attached" signature, you'll need to check <see cref="P:MailBee.Security.SmimeResult.DecryptedMessage"/> of the returned value of this method in order
            to get access to the original (unsigned) message. This is because messages with attached signatures
            look like encrypted messages so it's required to decode such a message (like in decryption procedure) to get access to the original message. Therefore checking the signature may also extract
            the original message from it. If <see cref="P:MailBee.Security.SmimeResult.DecryptedMessage"/> is not set (null reference) in the returned value of this method, this means the message has so-called "detached"
            signature which is not encapsulated into the original message contents but simply added as attachment. In this case, <paramref name="message"/> input parameter already refers to the original message
            and there is no need to extract anything.</para>
            <para><paramref name="extraStore"/> usually needs to be set if the system default store lacks
            a certification authority which issued the certificate the message is signed with. This is common case for ASP.NET
            web applications because ASP.NET user has fewer certification authorities in its system default store than
            regular Windows users. See ASP.NET S/MIME Demo sample project shipped with MailBee for details.</para>
            <para>To check the message verification result, examine <see cref="P:MailBee.Security.SmimeResult.VerificationResult"/> property of the returned <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.SmimeResult"/> object.
            To access the signature certificate, use <see cref="P:MailBee.Security.SmimeResult.SignatureCertificate"/> property of the same object.</para>
            <para>If you need more detailed information about the message's signature (for instance, to learn the hashing algorithm used), enable <see cref="!:SetEnvelopedCmsOnDecrypt"/> property and examine
            <see cref="!:SmimeResult.SignedCmsResult"/> property in the returned <see cref="T:MailBee.Security.SmimeResult"/> object.</para>
            <para>To check if the original message had a digital signature, examine <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.IsSigned"/> property value of the original <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> object.</para>
            <para>To decrypt and verify a message within a single method call, use <see cref="M:MailBee.Security.Smime.DecryptAndVerify(MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,MailBee.Security.MessageVerificationFlags)"/> method or its overloads.</para>
            <note>This method can be slow in case if the certificate refers to a non-existing domain name (or local domain name while the current machine is not in that network).</note>

            Represents a task to send (or submit to the pickup folder) a single e-mail message
            or a series of e-mail messages created as a mail merge of a data table and an e-mail template.

            <remarks>
            <para>Send-mail job is a task for MailBee to create and/or send individual mail message or a
            series of messages based on a common template (mail merge).
            </para>
            <note>Mail merge over database is not supported in .NET Core and UWP apps yet.</note>
            <para>Jobs can be created using <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.AddJob(System.String,System.String,MailBee.Mime.EmailAddressCollection)"/> method of <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> class
            (there are several overloads for mail merge and single message jobs).</para>
            <para>Once one or more jobs have been added to the <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsPending"/> queue, the developer can
            request to start processing of these jobs. This processing usually involves sending out e-mail messages
            contained in jobs or submitting these e-mail messages to a pickup folder for direct delivery to the SMTP server or MailBee.NET Queue
            if it's installed on the same machine where MailBee-powered application is running.</para>
            <para>To start processing jobs, use <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SendJobs"/>, <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.BeginSendJobs(System.AsyncCallback,System.Object)"/>, or <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SubmitJobsToPickupFolder(System.String,System.Boolean)"/> methods.</para>
            <para>When the job assumes sending of a single e-mail message, no extra jobs are created. However,
            when the job is a mail merge job (and thus actually assumes creating and sending multiple messages), MailBee processes such job
            via creating a series of individual mail merge jobs (each of them assumes sending a single e-mail message). For instance, if a mail merge job for processing 100
            data rows has been put into processing, MailBee will finally end up with 100 items total in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsSuccessful"/> and <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsFailed"/> collections.
            This default behavior, however, can be changed with <see cref="!:Smtp.AddJob(string, string, EmailAddressCollection, System.Data.DataTable, object, bool, bool)"/> overload.
            </para>
            <note>The easiest way to perform mail merge is using <see cref="!:Smtp.SendMailMerge"/> method.
            It can be used to put a "mail merge over database" job into the queue
            and immediately process it, doing mail merge for each row in the data table with a e-mail template and then sending out
            resulting e-mail messages.</note>

            continue to the next job in the queue in the case of error. Still, the application has ways of tracking
            failures (for instance, <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.MessageNotSent"/> event or <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsFailed"/> collection).
            In the case of <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsFailed"/>, <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SendMailJob.ErrorReason"/> can be used for every job
            in this collection to determine exact reason of the error.</remarks>

            Represents a collection of assigned tasks of sending e-mails.

            <remarks>
            <para>In MailBee, instances of this class contain lists of mail messages
            or mail merge tasks which will be (or already have been) processed.</para>
            <para>
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsPending"/>, <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsRunning"/>, <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsSuccessful"/>,
            and <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsFailed"/> properties of <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> class have <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.SendMailJobCollection"/> type.</para>
            <para><see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsPending"/> contains jobs to be processed, <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsRunning"/> - currently being
            processed, <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsSuccessful"/> and <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsFailed"/> - finished jobs.</para>
            <para>During processing, jobs migrate between the collections (i.e. the job which had originally been placed
            into <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsPending"/> moves into <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsRunning"/> when processing starts,
            and ends up in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsSuccessful"/> or <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsFailed"/>).</para>
            <para>However, mail merge jobs may spawn additional jobs. I.e. if a mail merge job of processing 10 data table rows
            goes into processing, it resides in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsPending"/> for a while (and the number of rows yet to be processed
            sequentially decrements to 9, 8, etc). At the same time, rows which are being processed are converted into <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.SendMailJob"/>
            objects representing tasks to process a single data row as mail merge. Thus, usually mail merge of 10 data rows (a single job) finally ends
            up in 10 <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.SendMailJob"/> objects in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsSuccessful"/> or <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsFailed"/> collections.
            To change this behavior, create mail merge jobs using <see cref="!:Smtp.AddJob(string, string, EmailAddressCollection, System.Data.DataTable, object, bool, bool)">Smtp.AddJob(string, string, EmailAddressCollection, DataTable, object, bool, bool)</see> overload
            or its <see cref="!:IDataReader"/> version (<see cref="!:Smtp.AddJob(string, string, EmailAddressCollection, System.Data.IDataReader, bool, bool)">Smtp.AddJob(string, string, EmailAddressCollection, IDataReader, object, bool, bool)</see>).</para>
            <note>In .NET Core and UWP apps, only single-message mail jobs are supported. There is no mail merge over database support.</note>

            <para>When <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.RaiseEventsViaMessageLoop"/> is <b>true</b> (i.e. default value),
            MailBee uses this method to raise <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Connected"/> event. In WinForms application,
            the event will be raised on the message loop thread. In other applications (such as
            web or console applications), threading is not a concern, and the current thread
            MailBee is running on will be used.</para>
            <para>You can override this method in a derived class to force MailBee execute your own code
            instead of raising <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Connected"/> event. This may help to avoid threading issues
            in WinForms applications (because events may not be raised if the message loop thread
            is blocked for some reason, while calling overridden methods does not depend on the message
            loop thread state).</para>
            <para>Another solution of this problem is setting <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.RaiseEventsViaMessageLoop"/> to <b>false</b>
            and using <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Wait"/> method to block the message loop thread if needed. This way, you do not need
            to derive any descendant class from <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> class.</para>

            <para>EHLO/HELO command has a parameter which should the domain name of the host which
            will send mail. By default, MailBee uses either the IPv4 address of the current machine or the local host name if IPv4 address
            is not available. Usually, this behavior does not need to be changed. However, if the application
            logic requires the default behavior to be overridden, the developer can force any arbitrary string
            to be used as a parameter of HELO/EHLO command by setting <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.HelloDomain"/>
            property of the server which is already in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> collection, or

            <para>By default, the component sends EHLO command, which is an extended version of HELO
            command. An ESMTP-enabled server returns the list of server capabilities in reply
            to EHLO command. However, if the server does not support any ESMTP extensions,
            it will return an error. In this case, the component will try HELO command. However,
            the list of the server capabilities will not be available, and <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.GetExtensions"/>
            will return a null reference (<b>Nothing</b> in Visual Basic).</para>
            <para>If the application knows the server it uses does not support ESMTP, it can disable EHLO

            <para>By default, this method does nothing because authentication is optional in SMTP/ESMTP.</para>
            <para>If ESMTP auhtentication is enabled (<see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.AuthMethods"/> is not
            <see cref="F:MailBee.AuthenticationMethods.None"/>), this method will attempt to authenticate
            on the SMTP server using the best (most secure) authentication method specified
            in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.AuthMethods"/> value and supported by the server.</para>
            <para>If the login attempt fails, it might still be possible to send mail (with
            some restrictions, such as sending to local recipients only). Due to this,
            MailBee makes it possible to ignore authentication errors if <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.IgnoreLoginFailure"/>
            is set to <b>true</b>. <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.ErrorOccurred"/> warning event, however, will still be issued
            to let the application know about the problem.</para>
            <note>Another alternative to <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Login"/> method is using POP-before-SMTP
            authentication. It can be used if the mail server does not support ESMTP authentication,
            but still requires users to authnticate themselves in order to send mail. See
            <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.AuthPopBeforeSmtp(System.String,System.Int32,System.String,System.String)"/> method documentation for more information.</note>
            <para>For examples on using OAuth 2.0 authentication (XOAUTH2 in Gmail), see <see cref="T:MailBee.OAuth2"/> topic.</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>This sample connects to the SMTP server, sends greeting, and attempts to
            authenticate the user on the server. If the login fails, no exception is thrown
            (<see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.IgnoreLoginFailure"/> is set to <b>true</b>) but the application
            still gets notification about the login failure through handling <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.ErrorOccurred"/> event).

            <para>A multiple e-mails job is a task to perform mail merge over multiple data table rows
            with an e-mail template. Such job will be split into multiple smaller jobs (one per data row)

            the developer can start processing jobs. To send the resulting e-mails out,
            call <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SendJobs"/> method. To make the resulting e-mails be submitted
            to MailBee.NET Queue or IIS SMTP pickup folder, use <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SubmitJobsToPickupFolder(System.String,System.Boolean)"/> method.</para>

            This process repeats itself until only a single data row index is left in the multi-job, and this makes it a single-message job.
            Finally, it will be moved into <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsRunning"/> collection just like any other simple job.</para>
            <para>Once processing of a job is finished, it's moved from <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsRunning"/> into <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsSuccessful"/> or

            <exception cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeInvalidArgumentException"><i>value</i> is zero.</exception>
            <remarks>Multi-threading may greatly increase performance of send bulk mail (mail merge) and
            direct send operations (sending directly to recipients' SMTP servers through MX lookup). For instance, if the message
            is addressed to 5 recipients on the different domains (and therefore 5 SMTP connections
            must be made), the component can submit the message to all 5 SMTP servers simultaneously.
            <note type="caution">Some methods and properties of <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> component cannot be used in multi-thread mode.
            For instance, if there are 3 simultaneous SMTP connections opened, it's not possible to
            determine for which SMTP connection <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.GetServerResponse"/> method should
            return the response. In multi-thread mode, the developer should use <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/>
            class events in order to track progress of operations. In multi-thread mode, <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.IsSmtpContext"/>
            always returns <b>false</b>.</note>
            <para>The maximum number of threads MailBee can utilize is 60. Threads are taken from
            <see cref="!:System.Threading.ThreadPool"/>. In .NET Core and UWP, Tasks are used instead.</para>
            <note>If logging SMTP session into a file is enabled (<see cref="P:MailBee.Logger.Enabled"/>
            property of <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Log"/> object is <b>true</b>), it's recommended to
            include context information into the log when multi-thread mode is used. The
            developer can use <see cref="F:MailBee.LogFormatOptions.AddContextInfo"/> flag for this purpose. The sample code
            in the bottom of this page demonstrates how this option can be used.
            If context information was not added, the log file would be more difficult to read and analyze.</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>This sample sends message using MX lookup (no SMTP relay server is used),
            spawning as many threads as required (<see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.MaxThreadCount"/> is -1). The message contains the following recipients:
            <i>user1@domain-a.com, user2@domain-a.com, user1@domain-b.com, user1@domain-c.com</i>.
            Thus, the message must be sent to SMTP servers of 3 domains: <i>domain-a.com, domain-b.com, domain-c.com</i>
            Since the maximum number of threads is not limited, the component will create 3 threads
            in this case.</para>
            <para>The <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.MessageSubmittedToServer"/> event is used to track submission
            of the message to each of 3 domains. If the message is successfully delivered to SMTP
            servers of all 3 domains, this event will occur 3 times total.</para>

            For each unique domain in the list of the message recipients domains (e.g.
            <i>host1, host2, host3</i> if the recipients are <i>joe@host3, kate@host1, bill@host2, tanya@host3, rob@host2</i>),
            the component makes a query to the DNS server to get the name of the SMTP server
            which accepts mail for the corresponding domain (for instance, <i>mx.host1, smtp.host2, mx-5.large-isp</i>
            for <i>host1, host2, host3</i>), and then sends mail directly to these servers.
            If more than one SMTP server accepts mail for the given domain, the highest-priority
            server will be tried first. If it fails, other servers will be tried accordingly their
            priorities.</para>
            <para>If multiple DNS servers specified, MailBee will distribute load between the available
            DNS servers to improve performance. However, if some servers have lower <see cref="P:MailBee.DnsMX.DnsServer.Priority"/>
            than others, they will not be tried unless primary servers fail. This allows developers
            to implement high-performance and reliable send mail systems.</para>
            <para>If both <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.DnsServers"/> and <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> collections are non-empty,
            MailBee compares priorities of the highest-priority DNS server and the highest-priority SMTP relay server.
            If top prority SMTP server has the same or higher priority than top priority DNS server,
            MailBee will try to send mail using SMTP relay server first. If it fails, DNS MX lookup
            (direct send) will be used. Thus, it's possible to easily combine both "direct send"
            and "send to relay SMTP server" methods to improve reliability of send mail operation
            even further.</para>
            <note>Higher priority value is actually lower integer value. I.e. 0 is top priority while
            999 is the lowest priority.</note>
            <note type="caution">Direct send is often used by spammers. Thus, many mail services do not accept
            mail submissions from unknown hosts. It's recommended to perform direct sending from the domain
            which has at least one MX record assigned. In this case, the hosts with which the application
            is communicating will be able to verify the sender domain and accept the message submission request.</note>

             in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.DnsServers"/> collection, the message will be sent in direct send mode.
             In this mode, MailBee performs DNS MX lookup for all recipients domains to discover which hosts
             accept mail for these domains (such hosts are called <i>SMTP MX</i> servers), and then sends
             the message directly to these servers. In other words, MailBee itself
             will act as a relay SMTP server. However, it's recommended sending host have assigned DNS MX or A record.
             Systems which actively send mail but don't have any DNS records assigned are typically used by spammers, thus many
             SMTP MX servers will not accept mail from such host and may even blacklist its IP address.</para>

             collections have the same priority, <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> is preferred).
             If sending to some or all recipients fails due to failure of
             some servers, another collection will be used to send the message to the failed recipients. Thus,
             sending to both SMTP relay servers and servers discovered via DNS MX lookup can be
             performed in a single <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Send"/> method call, providing high level of reliability of
             send mail operation.</para>
             <note>SMTP and DNS server priority values are zero-based.
             0 is the highest priority while 999 is the lowest priority.</note>
             <para>In direct send mode, it's possible to send the message to all SMTP MX servers simultaneously.
             This may greatly improve performance when sending to multiple recipients. The developer

            If it fails, other servers will be tried accordingly their priority values.</para>
            <para>If <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> collection is empty or the priority of the most preferred SMTP relay server
            in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> collection is less than than the priority of the most preferred DNS server
            in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.DnsServers"/> collection, the message will be sent in direct send mode.
            In this mode, MailBee performs DNS MX lookup for all recipients domains to discover which hosts
            accept mail for these domains (such hosts are called <i>SMTP MX</i> servers), and then sends
            the message directly to these servers. In other words, MailBee itself
            will act as a relay SMTP server. However, it's recommended sending host have assigned DNS MX or A record.
            Systems which actively send mail but don't have any DNS records assigned are typically used by spammers, thus many
            SMTP MX servers will not accept mail from such host and may even blacklist its IP address.</para>
            <para>If both <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> and <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.DnsServers"/> collections are
            non-empty, the collection having higher priority server will be tried first (if top priority servers of both
            collections have the same priority, <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> is preferred).
            If sending to some or all recipients fails due to failure of
            some servers, another collection will be used to send the message to the failed recipients. Thus,
            sending to both SMTP relay servers and servers discovered via DNS MX lookup can be
            performed in a single <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Send"/> method call, providing high level of reliability of
            send mail operation.</para>
            <note>SMTP and DNS server priority values are zero-based.
            0 is the highest priority while 999 is the lowest priority.</note>
            <para>In direct send mode, it's possible to send the message to all SMTP MX servers simultaneously.
            This may greatly improve performance when sending to multiple recipients. The developer
            can enable multi-threading by setting <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.MaxThreadCount"/> property value
            to -1 (unlimited number of thread) or to the maximum number of threads the application is allowed to use.</para>

            server.</para>
            <para>If <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Connect"/> method was not called, <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Send"/> method will automatically
            connect to the server specified in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> collection, send the message,
            and then disconnect.</para>
            <para>If <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> collection contains more than one server, <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Connect"/>
            method will try to send the message to the top priority server (see <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.Priority"/>).
            If it fails, other servers will be tried accordingly their priority values.</para>
            <para>If <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> collection is empty or the priority of the most preferred SMTP relay server
            in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> collection is less than than the priority of the most preferred DNS server
            in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.DnsServers"/> collection, the message will be sent in direct send mode.
            In this mode, MailBee performs DNS MX lookup for all recipients domains to discover which hosts
            accept mail for these domains (such hosts are called <i>SMTP MX</i> servers), and then sends
            the message directly to these servers. In other words, MailBee itself
            will act as a relay SMTP server. However, it's recommended sending host have assigned DNS MX or A record.
            Systems which actively send mail but don't have any DNS records assigned are typically used by spammers, thus many
            SMTP MX servers will not accept mail from such host and may even blacklist its IP address.</para>
            <para>If both <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> and <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.DnsServers"/> collections are
            non-empty, the collection having higher priority server will be tried first (if top priority servers of both
            collections have the same priority, <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> is preferred).
            If sending to some or all recipients fails due to failure of
            some servers, another collection will be used to send the message to the failed recipients. Thus,
            sending to both SMTP relay servers and servers discovered via DNS MX lookup can be
            performed in a single <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Send"/> method call, providing high level of reliability of
            send mail operation.</para>
            <note>SMTP and DNS server priority values are zero-based.
            0 is the highest priority while 999 is the lowest priority.</note>
            <para>In direct send mode, it's possible to send the message to all SMTP MX servers simultaneously.
            This may greatly improve performance when sending to multiple recipients. The developer
            can enable multi-threading by setting <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.MaxThreadCount"/> property value
            to -1 (unlimited number of thread) or to the maximum number of threads the application is allowed to use.</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>This sample sends a message from address different from From: address specified
            in the message. This is useful when bounced messages should be processed and the developer
            wants to redirect bounced messages to another address. In this sample, From: is
            jdoe@domain.com while real sender's address (which will appear in Return-Path header value and
            where bounces will arrive to) is bounce@domain.com.

            <remarks>
            <para>This method is useful if you want to implement some kind of background mail queue. E-mails themselves can be created
            using other tools or with <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SubmitToPickupFolder(System.String,System.String,System.String,MailBee.Mime.EmailAddressCollection,System.Boolean)"/> method. <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SubmitToPickupFolder(System.String,System.String,System.String,MailBee.Mime.EmailAddressCollection,System.Boolean)"/> method can create
            .EML files with "X-Sender" and "X-Receiver" headers so that it's possible to implement scenarios when an e-mail needs to be sent
            from/to addresses different from its From/To/CC/BCC.</para>
            <note>This overload is different from <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.AddJob(System.String,MailBee.Mime.MailMessage,System.String,MailBee.Mime.EmailAddressCollection)"/> (it accepts
            <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> as a parameter) in the way it uses memory. The current overload (which takes just a filename of the e-mail message) does NOT internally call
            <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.LoadMessage(System.String)"/> to get the message in memory from the file and put it onto the waiting queue as a job. Instead, it loads the message
            into memory only when the job actually gets processed. Thus, if you added 100 e-mails as <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage"/> objects, all 100 will consume memory before
            they start to get sent. However, if you added 100 e-mails as files, the job list will contain just 100 filenames, not actual messages. The messages will be loaded
            and processed one-by-one and memory usage will be substantially lower. Of course, if you're using multi-threaded processing jobs, multiple messages will be
            processed simultaneously (and thus occupy more memory) but you'll still have significant memory usage benefit if number of threads
            is less than the number of messages in the queue.</note>
            <para>The note above does not apply to mail merge over database jobs. In that case, each e-mail is generated on the fly when it gets sent (not when the mail merge job
            is created). E-mails generated with mail merge over database
            do not occupy more memory than required in order to send out a single e-mail (or several e-mails in case of multi-threading).</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            <para>This sample implements a very simple e-mail queue dispatcher which drops a couple of e-mail files in a folder first,
            and then sends out all e-mail files in a folder. E-mails are save to and then taken from "C:\Queue\Pickup" folder. For successful e-mails,
            .EML file is then removed, for failed e-mails - moved to "C:\Queue\Bad" folder.</para>

            <para>This method can be used to retry processing of all failed jobs. For instance, there had been some kind
            of network failure during processing jobs and certain e-mails failed to be sent. Then, however, the network problem was fixed.
            In this case, the developer can issue <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.RetryFailedJobs"/> to put failed jobs back into the pending queue.
            Then, any method which processes jobs (such as <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SendJobs"/>) can be called to resume processing.</para>
            <para><see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.RetryFailedJobs"/> method takes all the jobs from <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.JobsFailed"/> collection and puts

            <note>This method is thread-safe. The developer may safely call it even if some jobs are already being
            actively processed in the current moment. This may be useful in the case if it's needed to retry failed
            jobs not waiting for completion of processing the remaining jobs. For instance, if <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SendJobs"/> method
            was still running when <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.RetryFailedJobs"/> was called, it will then process the newly added failed jobs as well as
            the remaining pending jobs.

            <para>Because this method does not stop jobs processing immediately but simply tells MailBee to

            <example>
            This console sample sends mail merge out, stopping the entire process if number of consecutive failures to send an e-mail
            exceeds 10. This allows the application to skip random errors of sending e-mails to specific e-mail addresses but stop
            processing in the case if the error becomes permanent. It's assumed that it's unusual to get 10 bad e-mail addresses one-by-one
            and such situation should be treated as possible failure of the mail server itself.
            <note>If the application is made multi-threaded (<see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.MaxThreadCount"/> is not 1), multiple threads
            will access <c>failureCount</c> variable simultaneously. Thus, to keep <c>failureCount</c> value accurate,
            the application must synchronize access to it. However, exact value of <c>failureCount</c> is not important in our case
            (even if synchronization issues made it evaluate to, let's say, 9 or 12 instead of 10) since we only need it to determine
            if it's big or not. It's no big difference if the application stopped after 9 or after 10 (or 12) consecutive failures.</note>

            <para><see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.TestSend(MailBee.SmtpMail.SendFailureThreshold)"/> method is especially useful in direct send scenarios (discovering
            SMTP MX servers via DNS MX lookup rather than using predefined SMTP relay server).
            When no SMTP relay server is used, it's not possible to send to all recipients without fail, and cancel
            sending if at least one recipient fails (so that the message would be sent either to
            all recipients or to nobody). This is because the message may be sent to many SMTP MX servers
            in direct send mode, and if it was already sent to the first server and fails for the second
            one, it's not possible to tell the first server to rollback and cancel the recent mail
            submission. This is different from sending to SMTP relay server, where entire send mail
            operation is a single transaction. If it's cancelled, no recipients previously submitted
            will receive the message. When sending to an SMTP relay server, the developer can use
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.AllowRefusedRecipients"/> property to control whether the component
            should return an error if at least one recipient fails.</para>
            <note>The mail message submission may still fail on <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Send"/> operation even if
            all recipients and the sender are valid. This typically occurs when the server
            accepts the sender and the recipients but rejects the message data (for instance,
            the message is too large, or the server decides the message contains spam or virus).
            Also, the server might be down at the moment when <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.Send"/> method gets called even if it was
            fine during <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.TestSend(MailBee.SmtpMail.SendFailureThreshold)"/> method call.</note>

            <note>By default, BCC header is not included into the message being sent. BCC
            recipients still receive the message, but other recipients have no way of knowing this.
            If required, the developer can suppress removing BCC header on mail send operation by setting
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MessageBuilderConfig.RemoveBccOnSend">Mime.MailMessage.Builder.RemoveBccOnSend</see> property to <b>false</b>.</note>

            If display name is included in BCC e-mail address, it's just ignored.

            However, MailBee can trap this exception if the error was not critical. For instance,
            if connecting to certain SMTP server fails but another server is available in reserve,
            the <see cref="T:MailBee.MailBeeException"/> will be thrown and then trapped by MailBee itself,

            <para><see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.ErrorOccurred"/> event allows the developer to track both warnings and critical
            errors because it's raised for a particular exception even if MailBee will trap this

            In this sample, the connection attempt is made twice (high priority and low priority
            servers are used). Connection to high-priority SMTP server fails (the server name is invalid)
            so <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.ErrorOccurred"/> event is raised, but no exception is thrown to the application
            code. Then, MailBee attempts to connect to the backup server. If this attempt fails too,
            <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.ErrorOccurred"/> event is raised again (now <see cref="P:MailBee.ErrorEventArgs.IsFinalError"/>
            will be <b>true</b> to indicate the error is not a warning), and the exception is thrown to

            <para>This event is raised just before MailBee will start making the connection (i.e. before <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SocketConnected"/> event).
            This lets you specify your own socket object in case if you need some special socket settings.
            If you need this, set <see cref="P:MailBee.SocketCreatingEventArgs.NewSocket"/> property to the socket object needed in your event handler.</para>
            <para>This event fires for mail server connections only. Connections with DNS servers (such as DNS MX lookup during direct send) don't trigger this event.</para>
            <note>It's possible that this event will fire multiple times in case if the host has multple endpoints assigned. For instance, if the first endpoint was IPv6,
            the connection could not be made but second endpoint (IPv4) would succeed. On each call of this event handler, your code must supply a new, fresh socket object (otherwise MailBee
            will create its own). By default, however, MailBee tries IPv4 addresses first (see <see cref="P:MailBee.Global.PreferIPv4Hosts"/>) so this situation is unlikely to happen.
            Another case would be if you have multiple SMTP servers in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> collection, the first server failed and fail-over server is tried.
            Mass-mailing, direct-send and POP-before-SMTP auth scenarios can also cause multiple connections to SMTP servers occur (in case of POP-before-SMTP, to POP3 server as well).
            This results in firing this event multiple times as well.</note>

            <item><description>Control whether particular messages should be skipped (not sent).
            This can be useful when performing mail merge tasks. To make the message be skipped,
            set <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.SendIt"/> to false.</description></item>
            <item><description>Fine-tune messages before they get sent.
            This is also useful in mail merge tasks if the developer wants to perform some actions
            on the messages which had already been merged. You can change properties of the mail message itself
            (returned by <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.MailMessage"/> property), change
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.ActualSenderEmail"/> or
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.ActualRecipients"/>.</description></item>
            <item><description>Change Delivery Status Notification (DSN) settings of the message.
            It's easier to specify a template for DSN Tracking-ID via setting <c>mailer.DeliveryNotification.TrackingID</c> value
            (where <c>mailer</c> is <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> instance) prior to calling <see cref="M:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SendJobs"/>.
            However, other DSN values (<see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.DeliveryNotificationOptions.NotifyCondition"/> and <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.DeliveryNotificationOptions.ReturnPortion"/>)
            can be set for every e-mail separately only in <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SendingMessage"/> event handler.
            This is because other DSN values are not strings and search-and-replace is not possible for them. However, most applications use the same
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.DeliveryNotificationOptions.NotifyCondition"/> and <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.DeliveryNotificationOptions.ReturnPortion"/> values for all
            e-mail messages within a mail merge job.</description></item>
            </list>
            </para>
            <note>If you changed the message sender or recipients via modification of
            the e-mail message itself (<see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.MailMessage"/> property),
            you should also update <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.ActualSenderEmail"/> or
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.ActualRecipients"/> as well (for instance,
            set them to a null reference (<b>Nothing</b> in Visual Basic) to tell MailBee to grab these values from
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.MailMessage"/> property.
            Alternatively, if you only changed <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.ActualSenderEmail"/> or
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpSendingMessageEventArgs.ActualRecipients"/>, the corresponding message headers
            won't be changed (the message will be sent from or to addresses different from those specified in the message
            headers).

            Occurs on a transient SMTP error which can be ignored because at least one fail-over SMTP server hasn't been tried yet.

            <remarks>
            <para>This event may not occur if only a single SMTP server is available for sending to the domain for which sending has failed.</para>
            <para>This event lets the application decide what to do when the current SMTP server reports that it cannot deliver your message to the given e-mail address. You can either let MailBee
            try another server or stop trying the current message. This choice is helpful because the library itself cannot determine if sending should be stopped. Two kinds of transient errors exists:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>Temporary errors which can be fixed if another server is tried (e.g. the current server is experiencing temporary failure).</description></item>
            <item><description>Temporary errors which occur by purpose (such as "try again later" grey-listing). You need to try again later, simply trying another server won't help.</description></item>
            </list>
            </para>
            <para>Unfortunately, there is no distinction between SMTP codes for these errors. Thus, the app or even the user will have to make choice based on their preferences
            (or you can examine the human-readable response from the server although this is not reliable). If you subscribe to this event, you can control this behavior. If you don't subscribe,
            MailBee will retry if there is at least one more SMTP relay server left (in case if you're sending via SMTP relay servers) and won't retry in case of direct send.</para>
            <para>This default behavior is a general recommendation: you should retry in case of relay SMTP servers (<see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/>) and don't retry if you're using direct send (MX lookup)
            so that <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.SmtpServers"/> is empty. SMTP servers obtained via MX lookup often use greylisting so in most cases retrying with another MX will make your IP address getting banned.
            If, however, your situation is different, you can use this event to adjust the default behavior.</para>

            <example>This sample sends enables retries of SMTP MX servers (if there are multiple available for the given recipient's e-mail domain) in case of direct sends.

            <summary>
            Represents an SMTP relay server to which the mail messages will be sent.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>This class is used to specify an SMTP relay server the mail messages should
            be submitted to. Another type of SMTP server is SMTP MX server which is a server
            which accepts mail for a particular domain. When the mail message is submitted to
            SMTP relay server, the relay server performs the following operations:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>The message is received from the client</description></item>
            <item><description>For each recipient e-mail address, the domain part is extracted,
            and duplicates are removed (example: for <i>user1@domain1.com, user2@domain1.com, user1@domain2.com, user3@domain1.com</i>),
            the list of unique domains is <i>domain1.com, domain2.com</i>)</description></item>
            <item><description>For each of the unique domains, DNS MX lookup query is sent to the DNS server</description></item>
            <item><description>For each domain, the DNS server returns the list of SMTP MX servers
            which accept mail for this domain</description></item>
            <item><description>The relay server then relays the mail message to SMTP MX server of each domain</description></item>
            </list>
            In other words, SMTP relay server dispatches the mail message received from the client,
            to the SMTP MX servers of the target recipients.</para>
            <para>To specify SMTP relay server in your application, call <c>mailer.SmtpServers.Add</c> method (assuming
            <c>mailer</c> is an instance of <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> class).</para>
            <note>When MailBee is used in direct send mode (by performing DNS MX lookup
            against DNS servers in <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.DnsServers"/> collection), MailBee itself acts
            as SMTP relay server, and dispatches the mail message to the MX servers of recipients domains.</note>
            </remarks>
            <example>Another example of specifying SMTP relay server in the application is available at
            <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.SslMode"/> topic.</example>

            for up to 30 seconds (actual delay values can reach 33 seconds). Due to this, MailBee increases the timeout value to 35000 milliseconds
            (35 seconds) after submitting e-mail data to the server even if the <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.Timeout"/> value is lower. Once
            the operation completes (or throws an exception), it's reverted back to the <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.Timeout"/> value. Of course,
            if you explicitly set <see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.SmtpServer.Timeout"/> to a value greater than 35000 milliseconds, no timeout correction for DATA/BDAT operation
            will be made.</remarks>

            Provides methods to parse winmail.dat (MS-TNEF) files.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>Usually, you'll use <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.Attachment.GetAttachmentsFromTnef"/> methods of <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.Attachment"/>
            class to extract contents from winmail.dat attachments in e-mail messages. However, in case if you already have winmail.dat file as a separate entity
            (not part of an e-mail message), you can use the methods of this class.</para>
            <para>MailBee.NET TNEF parser can also extract attachments from nested winmail.dat files. Once you call <see cref="M:MailBee.Tnef.TnefParser.GetAttachments(System.IO.Stream,MailBee.Mime.TnefExtractionOptions)"/>,
            you can iterate through the returned <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.AttachmentCollection"/> and check each individual <see cref="T:MailBee.Mime.Attachment"/> object
            for <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.Attachment.IsMessageInside"/> set to <b>true</b>.
            Then use <see cref="M:MailBee.Mime.Attachment.GetEncapsulatedMessage"/> method to get the contents of the nested winmail.dat,
            and its <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.Attachments"/> collection to get the attachments (or other properties like <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.BodyHtmlText"/> or
            <see cref="P:MailBee.Mime.MailMessage.BodyPlainText"/> to get text body). This works for any number of nesting levels.</para>
            <para>TNEF parser can also extract RTF body as <i>richbody.rtf</i> attachment (if it's present in winmail.dat). This works for nested winmail.dat files as well.</para>
            <para>All the methods are static (Shared in Visual Basic), you don't need to create an instance of this class.
            Setting MailBee.NET license key is not required either.</para>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            This example saves all attachments and RTF bodies in winmail.dat itself and in any e-mails nested in this winmail.dat.

            <para>This property is useful when using the <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> component.
            Unlike <see cref="T:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3"/> and <see cref="T:MailBee.ImapMail.Imap"/> components, <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> component can operate
            in multiple contexts</para>
            <para>When <see cref="T:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3"/> component is used, the context is always POP3.</para>
            <para>However, when <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/> component is used, the context may be somewhat
            like SEND-00.SMTP-04, which indicates the component is sending a mail message using multiple
            threads, and the current log entry corresponds to thread #4 (starting from zero).
            Another example is SEND-00.SMTP-00.POP3 which means the component currently operates in send mail
            mode, the connection to SMTP server on thread #0 is in progress, and POP-before-SMTP authentication
            is currently performed as a part of this connection procedure.</para>
            <para><see cref="P:MailBee.LogEntry.ContextInfo"/> value is especially useful when <see cref="T:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp"/>
            component operates in multi-thread mode (<see cref="P:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.MaxThreadCount"/> is not 1).
            In this case, many log entries are simultaneously added into the log by multiple threads. In this case,
            <see cref="P:MailBee.LogEntry.ContextInfo"/> allows the person who's viewing the log to group the log entries

            <para><see cref="T:MailBee.Logger"/> class also supports logging into memory buffer instead of a file
            (useful for those ASP.NET applications which have no permissions to write to disk).</para>
            <para>To prevent unlimited growth of the log file/memory buffer, the maximum size of

            <para>The developer has control of adding log messages. Each time the log entry is to
            be added into the log, MailBee components raise <b>LogNewEntry</b> event
            (see <see cref="E:MailBee.SmtpMail.Smtp.LogNewEntry">Smtp.LogNewEntry</see>,
            <see cref="E:MailBee.Pop3Mail.Pop3.LogNewEntry">Pop3.LogNewEntry</see>, and

            <example>This sample enables logging POP3 session into C:\Temp\pop3_log.txt file. The maximum size of
            the log file is restricted to 4 Kbytes. If the log file is going to exceed this size, it's renamed
            into C:\Temp\pop3_log-bak.txt, and new C:\Temp\pop3_log.txt log is started.
            <note>If C:\Temp\pop3_log.txt gets full again, it's again renamed to C:\Temp\pop3_log-bak.txt
            (old C:\Temp\pop3_log-bak.txt contents will be lost). Thus, the log will always reflect
            the latest activity, however, older data may be lost.</note>
